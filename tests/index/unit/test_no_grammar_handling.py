"""Tests for handling languages without tree-sitter grammars.

NOTE: As of 2025, tree-sitter has added grammar support for most programming
languages including F#, VB.NET, Erlang, PowerShell, Clojure, Dart, and Nim.
These tests are now skipped because the original premise (that certain popular
languages lack grammar support) is no longer valid.

The skipped_no_grammar code path still exists but is rarely exercised since
almost all recognized languages now have grammar support.
