"""Unified coverage parsing, merging, and reporting.

This package provides:
- Multi-format coverage parsing (8 formats)
- Max-hit merge across reports
- Structured JSON output for agents

Usage:
    from codeplane.testing.coverage import parse_artifact, merge, build_summary

    # Parse a coverage artifact
    report = parse_artifact(Path("coverage/lcov.info"))

    # Merge multiple reports
    merged = merge(report1, report2, report3)

    # Build structured summary for agents
    summary = build_summary(merged)

Supported formats:
    - lcov: pytest-cov, cargo-llvm-cov, dart test
    - cobertura: coverage.py, coverlet (.NET)
    - opencover: .NET with SequencePoint/BranchPoint
    - istanbul: Jest, Vitest, NYC (JavaScript)
    - jacoco: Java (Maven/Gradle)
    - gocov: Go test coverage profiles
    - clover: PHP (PHPUnit), Kotlin (kover)
    - simplecov: Ruby (SimpleCov)
