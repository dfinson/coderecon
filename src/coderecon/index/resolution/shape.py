"""Shape-based type inference (Pass 5).

Infers types for receivers based on their observed access patterns.
This is the fallback for dynamic languages without type annotations.

Algorithm:
1. For each ReceiverShapeFact (computed from MemberAccessFacts)
2. Build a "shape" = set of accessed members
3. Find TypeMemberFacts whose parent has matching members
4. Rank matches by overlap confidence
5. If high confidence, upgrade associated accesses

This runs AFTER Pass 3 (type-traced) as a fallback for unresolved accesses.
