"""Type-traced reference resolution (Pass 3).

Resolves member accesses by tracing through type annotations.
For example: ctx.mutation_ops.write_source() -> MutationOps.write_source def_uid.

This module runs AFTER Pass 2 (import resolution) and uses:
- TypeAnnotationFact: What type a variable/parameter has
- TypeMemberFact: What members a class/struct has
- MemberAccessFact: What member chains appear in code

The output is updated MemberAccessFact records with:
- resolved_type_path: e.g., "AppContext.MutationOps.write_source"
- final_target_def_uid: The def_uid of the final member
- resolution_method: "type_traced"
- resolution_confidence: 1.0 (type-traced is authoritative)
