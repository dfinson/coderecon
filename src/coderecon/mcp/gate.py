"""Unified confirmation gate system for CodeRecon MCP server.

Provides a single two-phase confirmation protocol used by all gated operations:
- Destructive actions (git reset --hard)
- Budget resets
- Pattern-break interventions (thrash detection)

Every gate follows the same protocol:
1. Server detects a gated condition
2. Server returns normal results + a gate block
3. Agent's next relevant call must include gate_token + gate_reason
4. Server validates token + reason, then either proceeds or rejects
