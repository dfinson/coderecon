"""Recon ground-truth dataset — loads curated query+GT pairs from JSON.

Registered as ``@dataset("cpl-recon-gt")`` for EVEE evaluation.

Each record contains:
    issue:          GitHub issue number (str)
    query_level:    Q1 (anchored/precise), Q2 (mixed/scoped), Q3 (unanchored/open)
    task:           The query text sent to recon
    gt_files:       List of ground-truth file paths
    gt_categories:  List of {path, category} dicts (E=Edit, C=Context, S=Supp)
    difficulty:     simple | medium | complex
