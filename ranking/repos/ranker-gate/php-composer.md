## Why this repo

- **Multi-module with clear boundaries**: Dependency resolution (SAT solver),
  package repository sources (Packagist, VCS, path), autoload generation,
  installer plugins, lock file management, script execution, platform
  requirements — each a distinct subsystem requiring navigation between them.
- **Well-structured**: Source under `src/Composer/` with clear namespace
  split. Dependency solver, repository layer, installer, downloader, and
  autoload generator are separated by concern.
- **Rich history**: 10K+ commits, foundational to the PHP ecosystem. Every
  PHP project uses it. PRs cover dependency resolution edge cases, repository
  source handling, and performance improvements.
- **Permissive**: MIT license.

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix `composer update --minimal-changes` removing unrelated packages

When running `composer update --minimal-changes pkg/specific`, unrelated
packages that have newer versions available are sometimes downgraded
to their minimum required version. The solver treats the `--minimal-changes`
flag as "minimize all changes" rather than "update only the specified
packages." Fix the solver to lock non-targeted packages at their
current versions.

### N2: Add `--sort` option to `composer show` command

The `composer show` command lists packages but provides no sorting
options. Add `--sort=name` (default, current behavior), `--sort=size`
(by installed size), and `--sort=date` (by last update date) options.
Include a `--reverse` flag for descending order.

### N3: Fix `SvnDriver::execute` not masking credentials in error output

When `SvnDriver` executes SVN commands with `--username` and
`--password` flags and the command fails, the error message logged
via `$io->writeError()` includes the password in cleartext. A user
running Composer in CI with verbose output inadvertently exposes
repository credentials in build logs. Mask the password value in
the error output before logging, consistent with how `Svn::cleanEnv`
already handles environment variables.

### N4: Fix `BumpCommand` not skipping packages with branch-alias constraints

When running `composer bump`, packages whose constraint is
`dev-main` or contains a branch alias (e.g., `dev-main as 2.0.0`)
are processed by the bumper, which produces invalid constraints
like `^dev-main`. The command should detect dev/branch-alias
constraints and skip them with an informational message instead of
writing a broken constraint to `composer.json`.

### N5: Fix `AutoloadGenerator` producing duplicate classmap entries

When a package defines both a `classmap` and a `psr-4` entry that overlap
on the same directory, `AutoloadGenerator` emits duplicate entries in the
generated `autoload_classmap.php`. The class scanner in `ClassMapGenerator`
does not deduplicate against PSR-4 discovered classes. Fix the generator
to detect overlapping autoload rules and emit each class exactly once,
preferring the PSR-4 entry.

### N6: Fix `PathRepository` symlink mode ignoring nested composer.json

When using a path repository with `"symlink": true` pointing at a directory
that contains subdirectories with their own `composer.json` files,
`PathRepository` only reads the top-level `composer.json` and silently
ignores nested packages. Fix `PathRepository` to correctly scope its
package discovery to only the target directory without descending into
subdirectories that are separate packages.

### N7: Fix `StatusCommand` not detecting uncommitted changes in source-installed packages

`composer status` checks for local modifications in source-installed
packages by running `git status` in each package directory. However,
it does not detect untracked files (new files added but not committed).
A developer who adds a new file inside `vendor/pkg/src/` gets no
warning before running `composer update`, which overwrites the vendor
directory. Include untracked files in the status output using
`git status --porcelain`.

### N8: Fix `ArchiveCommand` including `.git` directory in created archives

When `composer archive` creates a zip or tar archive from a local
path, the `ArchivableFilesFinder` includes the `.git` directory in
the archive, inflating the file size and potentially leaking
repository history. The finder should exclude `.git`, `.svn`, and
`.hg` version control directories by default when building the
file list for archiving.

### N9: Fix `SearchCommand` not respecting configured repository priority

`composer search` queries all configured repositories but displays
results in arbitrary order regardless of repository priority. When
a private Packagist repository is configured alongside the public
one, private packages appear interleaved with public results. Sort
search results by repository priority (order of declaration in
`composer.json`), then alphabetically within each repository.

### N10: Fix `ValidateCommand` not checking for conflicting `autoload` and `autoload-dev` paths

`composer validate` checks JSON schema correctness but does not
detect when `autoload` and `autoload-dev` PSR-4 entries map
overlapping namespace prefixes to different directories, which
causes unpredictable class loading depending on whether dev
dependencies are installed. Add a check that warns when both
sections define the same namespace prefix with different paths.

## Medium

### M1: Implement download integrity verification with content-hash validation

After downloading a package archive, verify the file's SHA-256
checksum against the `dist.shasum` value from the repository metadata
before extraction. On mismatch, delete the corrupted file, emit a
warning with both expected and actual hashes, and re-download once
before failing. Add a `--verify-downloads` CLI flag and a
`config.verify-downloads` option (default: true). Support disabling
verification for local/path repositories. Modify `FileDownloader`,
`ZipDownloader`, and `TarDownloader` to call the verification step
after the download completes but before extraction begins.

### M2: Add package size reporting to `ShowCommand` and post-install summary

After installation, users have no way to see how much disk space each
package consumes in `vendor/`. Add a `--sizes` flag to
`composer show` that calculates and displays the installed size
of each package by walking its vendor directory. Show sizes in
human-readable format (KB/MB). Add a post-install summary line
showing total `vendor/` size and the top 5 largest packages.
Support `--format=json` output of size data. Implement size
calculation in a new method on `Filesystem` and integrate it
into `ShowCommand` and `InstallCommand`'s output.

### M3: Implement workspace/monorepo support

Add `composer.json` workspace support for monorepos containing multiple
packages. A root workspace config lists member packages by directory.
Cross-references between workspace packages use local paths
automatically. `composer install` in the root resolves dependencies
for all workspace members together, deduplicating shared dependencies.
Add `--workspace-filter=pkg/*` to operate on a subset.

### M4: Add `composer outdated --major-only` and semver-level categorization

The `outdated` command shows all outdated packages but does not
categorize them by the semver level of the available update. Add
`--major-only`, `--minor-only`, and `--patch-only` filter flags
that limit output to packages with updates at the respective
semver level. Display a color-coded semver column (red for major,
yellow for minor, green for patch) in the default table output.
Add `--format=markdown` for pasting into pull request descriptions.
Determine semver level by comparing the locked version against the
latest available version using `VersionParser`.

### M5: Add configurable retry and mirror fallback to Downloader

The download layer currently fails after a single HTTP timeout or 5xx
error. Implement configurable retry logic in the Downloader subsystem:
exponential backoff with jitter (default 3 retries), automatic fallback
to alternative mirror URLs listed in the repository metadata, and a
circuit-breaker that skips a mirror after repeated failures within a
time window. Add `--retry-count` and `--mirror-timeout` CLI options and
corresponding `config` keys.

### M6: Implement `composer diff` for comparing installed vs locked versions

Add a `composer diff` command that compares the currently installed
packages (from `vendor/composer/installed.json`) against the lock
file (`composer.lock`). Show packages that are installed but not in
the lock file, packages in the lock file but not installed, and
packages where the installed version differs from the locked
version. Support `--format=json` for CI integration. Add a
`--changelog` flag that fetches and displays changelog URLs from
repository metadata for each changed package. Integrate with
`Locker`, `RepositoryManager`, and the installed repository.

### M7: Add dependency tree depth limiting to the solver

Deeply nested dependency trees slow resolution and increase the
risk of version conflicts. Add a `config.max-depth` option
(default: unlimited) that causes the solver to emit a warning
when the dependency graph exceeds the configured depth, and a
`--max-depth=N` CLI option for `update` and `require` that
makes the solver reject solutions deeper than N levels. Report
the deepest dependency path found during resolution. Implement
depth tracking in the `Solver` by augmenting rule generation
in `RuleSetGenerator` and adding depth attributes to `Pool`
entries. Display the deepest path in the `DependencyResolver`
output when verbosity is enabled.

### M8: Implement autoload generation caching

The `AutoloadGenerator` rebuilds classmap and PSR-4 autoload files from
scratch on every `composer dump-autoload`. Implement a cache layer that
stores the previously generated autoload state and only regenerates
entries for packages whose installed version or autoload configuration
changed since the last dump. Add a cache manifest file alongside the
generated autoloader. Support `--force` to bypass the cache. Measure
and log time savings for large dependency trees.

### M9: Add `composer bin` for managing vendor binary symlinks

Vendor binaries in `vendor/bin/` are created as symlinks or proxy
scripts during installation, but there is no command to inspect or
manage them. Add a `composer bin` command with subcommands:
`composer bin list` shows all available binaries with their
providing package and resolved path, `composer bin path <name>`
prints the absolute path to a binary, and `composer bin check`
verifies that all expected symlinks exist and point to valid
targets. Integrate with `InstallationManager` to read the binary
registry and `Filesystem` to validate symlink targets.

### M10: Implement `composer depends --tree` with version constraint display

The `depends` command shows which packages require a given package
but only displays one level of dependents. Add a `--tree` flag
that recursively walks the dependency graph upward from the target
package to the root requirements, displaying a nested tree of each
path. At each node, show the version constraint that creates the
dependency (`vendor/a ^2.0 → vendor/b ~1.5 → target >=1.0`).
Highlight paths that pass through `require-dev` differently from
production paths. Integrate with `BaseDependencyCommand` and the
`Locker`'s installed repository for graph traversal.

## Wide

### W1: Add plugin sandboxing for security

Implement a security sandbox for Composer plugins. Plugins currently
have full access to the filesystem and network. Add a permission system
where plugins declare required capabilities (filesystem read/write paths,
network hosts, command execution) and the user approves them on first
use. Store approved permissions in a lock file. Block undeclared
operations at runtime. Add `composer plugin:audit` to review plugin
permissions.

### W2: Implement dependency resolution visualization and debugging

Add rich dependency resolution diagnostics: visual dependency tree
(`composer why-tree pkg/name`), conflict explanation with the full
resolution trace (`composer why-not pkg/name:2.0` with step-by-step
solver reasoning), resolution time profiling (which constraints took
the longest to satisfy), and a browser-based interactive dependency
graph that shows version constraints, conflicts, and resolution paths.

### W3: Implement lock file conflict auto-resolution for merge workflows

When merging branches that both modified `composer.lock`, Git leaves
conflict markers that require manual resolution. Implement a `composer
lock:resolve` command that parses the conflicted lock file, extracts both
sides' package lists, re-resolves the combined dependency set against
the merged `composer.json`, and writes a clean lock file. Handle cases
where both branches added conflicting versions of the same package,
where one branch removed a package the other updated, and where platform
requirements diverged. Integrate with the solver to detect unresolvable
conflicts and report them clearly.

### W4: Add dependency license compliance checking

Implement a `composer license:check` command that validates all installed
packages against a configurable license policy. Define allowed and
forbidden license identifiers in `composer.json` under an `extra` key.
Walk the full dependency tree including transitive dependencies, extract
SPDX license identifiers from each package's metadata, flag unknown or
ambiguous licenses, support SPDX compound expressions (AND, OR, WITH),
and generate a compliance report in text, JSON, and HTML formats. Add a
`--fail-on=deny` flag for CI pipelines that exits non-zero on policy
violations.

### W5: Implement repository priority and constraint routing

Add a repository priority system where each configured repository has
a numeric priority and optional package pattern filters. When resolving
dependencies, the `RepositoryManager` should prefer higher-priority
repositories, only falling back to lower-priority ones if a package
is not found or the version constraint cannot be satisfied. Support
per-package repository pinning in `composer.json` to force a specific
package to come from a specific repository. Handle version conflicts
across repositories by reporting which repository provided each
candidate version, and integrate priority into the solver's rule
generation in `DependencyResolver`.

### W6: Add `composer ci` meta-command for continuous integration workflows

Implement a `composer ci` command that orchestrates a full CI pipeline:
validate `composer.json` schema, verify `composer.lock` is up-to-date,
install dependencies with `--no-interaction`, run `composer audit` for
security advisories, execute configured test scripts, generate a
classmap-authoritative autoloader, and produce a summary report. Each
step should be independently skippable via `--skip=audit,test`. Support
`--fail-fast` to stop on first failure. Emit structured JSON output
suitable for CI systems. Add timing information for each step and an
overall pass/fail status code.

### W7: Implement cross-version dependency testing

Add a `composer test:matrix` command that tests the project against
multiple dependency version combinations. Parse each dependency's
version constraint, enumerate the lowest, highest, and a configurable
set of intermediate versions, generate a test matrix, and run the
configured test script against each combination. Parallelize test runs
up to a configurable concurrency limit. Use the solver to verify each
combination is installable before testing. Report a compatibility matrix
showing which version combinations pass or fail, including the specific
failure output for failed combinations.

### W8: Implement a plugin capability and lifecycle system

Redesign the plugin system to support a formal capability model and
lifecycle hooks. Define a `PluginCapability` interface that plugins
implement to declare the events they handle (pre/post install, resolve,
download, autoload, script execution). Add plugin ordering and priority
to control execution sequence when multiple plugins handle the same
event. Implement a plugin lifecycle with `activate`, `deactivate`, and
`uninstall` phases so plugins can perform cleanup. Add a `composer
plugin:list` command showing installed plugins, their capabilities,
and execution order. Support lazy plugin loading so plugins are only
instantiated when their declared events fire.

### W9: Implement offline mode with pre-populated cache

Add comprehensive offline mode support to Composer. When online,
`composer cache:prepare` downloads and caches all metadata and archives
for the current dependency tree plus a configurable depth of version
alternatives. When offline, Composer falls back to the local cache for
all repository metadata, package downloads, and VCS operations. Track
cache freshness per-package and warn when cached data exceeds a
configurable age. Support exporting and importing the cache as a
portable archive for air-gapped environments. Modify the
`RepositoryManager`, `Downloader`, and `Factory` to transparently
check cache availability before network access.

### W10: Add structured logging and telemetry across all subsystems

Implement a structured logging framework that replaces ad-hoc output
across all Composer subsystems. Define log channels for resolver,
installer, downloader, autoloader, plugin, and repository operations.
Each log entry includes a timestamp, channel, severity, structured
context data, and a correlation ID that ties together all operations
within a single command invocation. Support configurable log sinks
(stderr, file, JSON-lines) via `composer.json` config. Add
`--log-level` and `--log-file` CLI options. Implement performance
telemetry that records timing for dependency resolution, downloads,
and autoload generation, and optionally reports anonymized telemetry
to a configurable endpoint.

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in res/composer-schema.json

The project configuration file `res/composer-schema.json` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in res/composer-schema.json, and update CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/support-request---question.md`, `res/composer-schema.json`, `res/composer-lock-schema.json`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
