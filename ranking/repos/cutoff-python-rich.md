## Why this repo

- **Well-structured**: Clean single-package layout under `rich/` with
  per-concern modules — console output (`console.py`), styled text
  (`text.py`), color system (`color.py`, `style.py`), tables
  (`table.py`), panels (`panel.py`), trees (`tree.py`), syntax
  highlighting (`syntax.py`), markdown rendering (`markdown.py`),
  progress bars (`progress.py`), live display (`live.py`), and
  tracebacks (`traceback.py`). One developer can follow the full
  render pipeline from widget to terminal segments.
- **Rich history**: 5K+ commits, 50K+ stars. The most widely used
  Python terminal formatting library. PRs cover rendering edge cases,
  new renderables, and style system extensions.
- **Permissive**: MIT license.

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix Console.print not respecting markup=False when using Text objects

When `Console.print()` is called with `markup=False`, markup tags inside
plain strings are correctly escaped, but `Text` objects that contain
literal bracket characters in their content are still parsed for markup
during rendering. The issue is in the render pipeline where `Text`
objects bypass the `markup` flag. Fix the `Console._render_buffer()`
method to propagate the `markup=False` setting to `Text` rendering.

### N2: Fix Style.__add__ not preserving link attribute when combining styles

When two `Style` objects are combined with `+`, if the first style has a
`link` attribute and the second does not, the link is dropped from the
resulting style. The `Style.__add__()` method should carry forward the
link from the left operand when the right operand has no link set. Fix
the style combination logic in `style.py`.

### N3: Fix Color.parse not handling uppercase hex codes

`Color.parse("#FF5733")` raises a `ColorParseError` because the hex
regex only matches lowercase hex digits. The color parser in `color.py`
should be case-insensitive for hex color codes. Fix the regex pattern
in `Color.parse()` to accept both upper and lowercase hex characters.

### N4: Fix Table not rendering empty cells when show_lines=True

When a `Table` has `show_lines=True` and a cell contains an empty
string, the row separator lines are misaligned because the empty cell
is measured as zero height instead of one line. Fix the cell height
calculation in `table.py` to ensure empty cells occupy at least one
line when `show_lines` is enabled.

### N5: Fix markup.render not closing tags at string boundary

When markup text ends with an unclosed tag like `"[bold]hello"`, the
`render()` function in `markup.py` silently drops the unclosed style
instead of applying it to the remaining text. Fix the markup parser to
implicitly close any open tags at the end of the input string.

### N6: Fix Segment.split_cells not handling zero-width characters

`Segment.split_cells()` in `segment.py` incorrectly counts zero-width
characters (ZWJ, combining marks) as occupying one cell, causing
misaligned output when splitting segments at a cell boundary. Fix the
cell measurement to use `cell_len()` for zero-width character detection.

### N7: Fix Tree guide characters breaking with non-UTF-8 console encoding

When the console encoding is ASCII, `Tree` renders guide characters
(box-drawing glyphs) as `?` without falling back to ASCII-safe
alternatives. Fix the `Tree.__rich_console__()` method to detect the
console encoding and use ASCII guide characters (`|`, `+`, `-`) when
the encoding cannot represent the default Unicode guides.

### N8: Fix Panel title truncation not adding ellipsis

When a `Panel` title is longer than the panel width, the title is
hard-truncated without any visual indicator. Fix `Panel._render_title()`
to add an ellipsis (`…`) when the title must be truncated, preserving
one character of width for the ellipsis character.

### N9: Fix prompt.Confirm accepting "y " (trailing space) as invalid

`Confirm.ask()` strips leading whitespace but not trailing whitespace
from user input, causing `"y "` to be rejected as an invalid response.
Fix the input processing in `prompt.py` to strip both leading and
trailing whitespace before validation.

### N10: Fix Pretty not handling recursive dataclass references

When `pretty.py` encounters a dataclass that references itself (e.g., a
tree node with a `children: list[Node]` field), the pretty printer
enters infinite recursion instead of detecting the cycle and printing
an ellipsis placeholder. Fix the `_traverse()` function to track visited
object IDs and emit `...` for cycles.

## Medium

### M1: Implement column-span support in Table

Add support for cells that span multiple columns in `Table`. Introduce a
`colspan` parameter on `Table.add_row()` that allows a cell to stretch
across adjacent columns. Requires changes to the column sizing algorithm
in `table.py`, the cell rendering loop to merge columns, and the border
drawing logic to omit internal column separators for spanned cells.

### M2: Add style inheritance for nested renderables

Implement style inheritance so that a `Panel` or `Group` can set a base
style that all child renderables inherit unless overridden. Requires
changes to `Console.render()` to pass an inherited style down the render
tree, updates to `Text` and other renderables to merge the inherited
style with their own, and changes to `Segment` to apply cascading styles.

### M3: Implement conditional markup tags based on terminal capabilities

Add conditional markup syntax `[on color_system>=256]...[/on]` that only
applies enclosed styles when the terminal supports the required color
depth. Requires extending the markup parser in `markup.py` to recognize
conditional tags, querying `Console.color_system` during rendering, and
updating the `Style` resolution to skip unsupported styles gracefully.

### M4: Add CSV and TSV export for Table

Implement `Table.export_csv()` and `Table.export_tsv()` methods that
output table data as comma- or tab-separated values, stripping all
styling. Requires extracting plain text from styled cells using
`Text.plain`, handling multi-line cells by joining with spaces, and
supporting header inclusion/exclusion. Add corresponding
`Console.save_csv()` convenience methods.

### M5: Implement collapsible sections in Tree

Add a `collapsed` parameter to `Tree.add()` that marks a subtree as
collapsed by default. When rendered, collapsed nodes show a `[+]`
indicator instead of their children. When used with `Live`, clicking
or pressing a key toggles expansion. Requires changes to `Tree`
rendering, guide character logic, and integration with `Live` for
interactive toggling.

### M6: Add word-wrap mode to Text with hyphenation

Implement a `wrap_mode="word"` option for `Text` that wraps at word
boundaries instead of character boundaries. When a single word exceeds
the available width, apply simple hyphenation rules (break at syllable
boundaries using a basic algorithm). Requires changes to `Text.wrap()`,
the `Segment` splitting logic, and the `Console.render()` width
calculation.

### M7: Implement progress bar ETA smoothing with exponential moving average

Replace the current linear ETA estimation in `progress.py` with an
exponential moving average that smooths out speed fluctuations. Add a
`smoothing` parameter to `Progress` that controls the EMA weight.
Requires changes to `Task.speed`, the `TimeRemainingColumn`
calculation, and the `TransferSpeedColumn` display.

### M8: Add theme hot-reloading from TOML files

Implement `Theme.from_toml()` that loads styles from a TOML file and
`Console.load_theme()` that watches the file for changes and reloads
styles automatically. Requires a TOML parser integration in `theme.py`,
a file-watcher thread in `Console`, and re-rendering of active `Live`
displays when the theme changes.

### M9: Implement Segment-level caching for repeated renders

Add a render cache to `Console` that stores `Segment` output for
renderables that have not changed. Use a content-hash key so that
identical renderables hit the cache. Requires a cache store in
`Console`, a `__rich_hash__()` protocol method on renderables, and
cache invalidation when the console width changes.

### M10: Add accessibility attributes to Console output

Implement ANSI OSC sequences for screen reader accessibility: add a
`role` parameter to `Panel`, `Table`, and `Tree` that emits semantic
annotations. Add `Console.announce()` for screen reader announcements.
Requires changes to `Segment` to carry accessibility metadata, updates
to the `Console._render_buffer()` to emit OSC sequences, and additions
to `Panel`, `Table`, and `Tree` for role propagation.

### W1: Implement a terminal UI widget system with focus management

Add an interactive widget system with `Input`, `Button`, `Select`, and
`Checkbox` widgets that render in a `Live` context and respond to
keyboard input. Implement focus management with tab-order navigation,
a `Form` container that groups widgets, and a submit action that returns
collected values. Changes span `live.py` for input handling, new widget
modules, `console.py` for raw-mode input, `segment.py` for cursor
positioning, and `style.py` for focus-state styles.

### W2: Add HTML export with faithful style reproduction

Implement `Console.save_html()` that renders console output as an HTML
page with CSS styles matching the terminal appearance. Support all
style attributes (colors, bold, italic, strikethrough, links),
preserve table layouts using CSS grid, render syntax highlighting
with Pygments CSS classes, and include a dark/light theme toggle.
Changes span `console.py` for the export entry point, a new
`html_export.py` module, `style.py` for CSS conversion, `table.py`
for grid layout, and `syntax.py` for CSS class integration.

### W3: Implement a dashboard layout system with auto-refreshing panels

Add a `Dashboard` class that arranges multiple `Live` renderables in a
grid layout computed from terminal dimensions. Each panel auto-refreshes
independently at configurable intervals. Support panel resizing on
terminal resize, panel-level titles and borders, and a status bar.
Changes span `layout.py` for grid computation, `live.py` for multi-
renderable refresh, `console.py` for terminal resize detection,
`panel.py` for titled containers, and `segment.py` for screen
buffer management.

### W4: Implement a theming and plugin system for custom renderables

Add a plugin architecture that allows third-party packages to register
custom renderables, styles, and markup tags via entry points. Implement
a `PluginManager` that discovers plugins, validates their interfaces,
resolves conflicts (duplicate tag names), and exposes them through the
`Console` API. Changes span `console.py` for plugin integration, a new
`plugins.py` module, `markup.py` for custom tag dispatch, `theme.py`
for plugin-provided styles, and `style.py` for extended attribute
registration.

### W5: Add internationalization support for all user-facing strings

Implement i18n across Rich's user-facing output. All error messages,
progress bar labels ("eta", "elapsed", "speed"), prompt defaults
("y/n"), column headers in `inspect()`, and traceback labels should be
translatable via gettext. Support locale detection from environment
variables and user-provided translation catalogs. Changes span
`progress.py`, `prompt.py`, `_inspect.py`, `traceback.py`,
`logging.py`, and a new `_locale.py` module.

### W6: Implement a test harness for renderable output verification

Add a testing framework `rich.testing` that captures rendered output
as `Segment` lists and provides assertion helpers: `assert_contains`,
`assert_style`, `assert_dimensions`, and snapshot testing for visual
regression. Include a pytest plugin with fixtures for `Console`
capture. Changes span a new `testing.py` module, a pytest plugin
module, `console.py` for capture mode, `segment.py` for segment
comparison, and `style.py` for style matching utilities.

### W7: Implement streaming log viewer with filtering and search

Add a `LogViewer` renderable that displays log records in a scrollable,
filterable live view. Support level-based coloring, regex search with
match highlighting, log source filtering, and timestamp formatting.
Implement a ring buffer for log storage and virtual scrolling for
performance. Changes span a new `log_viewer.py` module, `live.py` for
scroll input handling, `console.py` for raw-mode keyboard input,
`text.py` for search highlighting, `highlighter.py` for log-level
coloring, and `logging.py` for RichHandler integration.

### W8: Add automatic API documentation generation from Console recordings

Implement `Console.record()` mode that captures all output operations
as a replayable transcript, and `Console.export_docs()` that generates
Markdown or RST documentation from recordings. Support annotating
recordings with descriptions, grouping related outputs into sections,
and including code examples alongside rendered output. Changes span
`console.py` for recording, a new `docs_export.py` module, `text.py`
for plain-text extraction, `table.py` for Markdown table conversion,
`syntax.py` for code block formatting, and `markup.py` for markup-
to-Markdown translation.

### W9: Implement a diff viewer with side-by-side rendering

Add a `Diff` renderable that displays unified or side-by-side diffs
with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and inline change highlighting.
Support configurable context lines, word-level diff highlighting within
changed lines, and collapsible unchanged sections. Changes span a new
`diff.py` module, `syntax.py` for language-aware highlighting, `text.py`
for word-level diff marking, `table.py` for side-by-side layout,
`panel.py` for diff headers, and `console.py` for pager integration.

### W10: Implement a notification and toast system for terminal applications

Add a `Notifications` system that displays temporary messages (toasts)
overlaid on existing console output. Support priority levels (info,
warning, error), auto-dismiss timers, stacking of multiple notifications,
animation (slide-in/fade), and an action callback for interactive
toasts. Changes span a new `notifications.py` module, `live.py` for
overlay rendering, `console.py` for screen buffer compositing,
`segment.py` for z-order layering, `style.py` for notification-level
theming, and `layout.py` for overlay positioning.
