## Why this repo

- **Multi-crate workspace**: Core ORM (`diesel`), derive macros (`diesel_derives`), CLI (`diesel_cli`), migrations (`diesel_migrations`), dynamic schema (`diesel_dynamic_schema`)
- **Multi-backend**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite backends with shared abstractions and backend-specific query builders
- **Complex type system**: Extensive use of Rust's type system for compile-time SQL validation, trait-based query building, and zero-cost abstractions

## Tasks

33 tasks (11 narrow, 11 medium, 11 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix `AnsiTransactionManager` not resetting state after connection-level error during commit

When `commit_transaction` encounters a connection-level error (not a database error), the `TransactionManagerStatus` is left in `InError` state but the actual database transaction may have been committed. Subsequent operations on the connection panic with "Transaction manager is in an error state" even though the connection is usable.

### N2: Fix `COPY FROM` sink not flushing partial buffer on early drop

In `diesel/src/pg/connection/copy.rs`, the `CopyFromSink` uses `Write` trait methods. If the sink is dropped without calling `finish()`, any buffered data in the underlying `RawConnection` is silently lost. The `Drop` impl should send the remaining buffer and signal end-of-copy to PostgreSQL.

### N3: Add `returning` clause support for `UPDATE` statements on SQLite

The `returning.rs` in `diesel/src/sqlite/query_builder/` implements returning for INSERT but the `UpdateStatement` query fragment impl for SQLite doesn't include a path for the `RETURNING` clause, even though SQLite 3.35+ supports it.

### N4: Fix `debug_query` displaying incorrect bind parameter order for MySQL `LIMIT ... OFFSET`

In `diesel/src/mysql/query_builder/limit_offset.rs`, MySQL uses `LIMIT ?, ?` syntax. The `DebugQuery` output shows the offset and limit parameters reversed compared to what's actually sent to MySQL, because the bind collector visits them in declaration order rather than MySQL's expected order.

### N5: Add `Fixed(usize)` variant to `CacheSize` for bounded statement caching

The `CacheSize` enum in `connection/mod.rs` currently supports only `Unbounded` (cache all statements) and `Disabled` (no caching). Add a `Fixed(usize)` variant that limits the statement cache to a maximum number of prepared statements, evicting the least-recently-used entry when the limit is reached. Implement the LRU eviction strategy in `connection/statement_cache/mod.rs` and ensure `mysql/connection/stmt/mod.rs` respects the new variant alongside the existing two.

### N6: Fix `remove_unsafe_foreign_keys_for_codegen` in `diesel_cli` silently dropping composite foreign keys

In `diesel_cli/src/infer_schema_internals/foreign_keys.rs`, the `remove_unsafe_foreign_keys_for_codegen` function explicitly filters out any `ForeignKeyConstraint` whose `foreign_key_columns` field has more than one entry, logging a debug message and returning `None`. This silently omits all composite (multi-column) foreign keys from code generation. Extend the function to emit a meaningful warning via `tracing::warn!` for each dropped composite FK, and update `guide_drafts/migration_guide.md` to document why composite foreign keys are excluded and what users should do manually.

### N7: Add PostgreSQL regex match expression operators

PostgreSQL supports case-sensitive (`~`, `!~`) and case-insensitive (`~*`, `!~*`) regular expression match operators that have no equivalent in other backends. The PostgreSQL expression module at `diesel/src/pg/expression/operators.rs` defines many PG-specific infix operators but none for regex matching. Add `Regexp`, `NotRegexp`, `RegexpInsensitive`, and `NotRegexpInsensitive` infix operators in `pg/expression/operators.rs` and expose them as `regexp`, `not_regexp`, `regexp_insensitive`, and `not_regexp_insensitive` methods via `PgExpressionMethods` in `diesel/src/pg/expression/expression_methods.rs`.

### N8: Fix `MigrationHarness::pending_migrations` sorting migrations with non-zero-padded numeric versions

In `diesel_migrations/src/migration_harness.rs`, `pending_migrations` sorts the remaining unapplied migrations via `sort_unstable_by` using `MigrationVersion`'s derived `Ord`, which performs lexicographic string comparison. For migration version strings that are plain integers without zero-padding (e.g. `"1"`, `"2"`, `"10"`), lexicographic order produces `"1"`, `"10"`, `"2"` instead of the correct numeric order `"1"`, `"2"`, `"10"`. Add a numeric-fallback comparator: if both version strings parse as `u64`, compare them numerically; otherwise fall back to lexicographic comparison.

### N9: Add `truncate_table` DSL function for PostgreSQL and MySQL

The query builder supports `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT` but not `TRUNCATE TABLE`. Add a `truncate` function in `diesel/src/query_builder/functions.rs` that generates `TRUNCATE TABLE <table>` with optional `CASCADE`/`RESTRICT` for PostgreSQL.

### N10: Fix `InferConnection::from_url` not respecting SSL parameters in PostgreSQL connection URLs

In `diesel_cli/src/database.rs`, `InferConnection::from_url` parses the database URL but strips query parameters like `sslmode=require` and `sslcert=...`. The CLI's schema inference connects without SSL even when the database requires it.

### N11: Fix `CHANGELOG.md` missing migration guidance section for breaking SQLite changes

The `CHANGELOG.md` documents breaking changes as bullet points but lacks structured migration guidance for SQLite-specific breaking changes (e.g., RETURNING clause behavior changes, WAL mode defaults). Add a "Migration Guide" subsection per release in `CHANGELOG.md`, cross-reference the corresponding `guide_drafts/migration_guide.md` content, and update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to require migration notes for any breaking change PR.

## Medium

### M1: Implement batch insert with automatic chunking for SQLite

SQLite enforces a hard limit on the number of bind parameters per statement (`SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER`, which defaults to 32766 but can be compiled lower). When inserting a large `Vec` of records, `insert_into(table).values(&records).execute(conn)` fails with a "too many SQL variables" error if `records.len() * columns` exceeds that limit. Implement automatic chunking in the SQLite `InsertStatement` that splits large inserts into multiple statements within a transaction.

### M2: Add query logging with execution timing to the Instrumentation system

The `InstrumentationEvent` enum in `connection/instrumentation.rs` tracks `StartEstablishConnection`, `FinishEstablishConnection`, `StartQuery`, `FinishQuery`, and `CacheQuery`. Extend it to include query execution duration measurement by capturing timestamps and adding a `QueryTiming` struct that's passed to `FinishQuery`. Update all three backend implementations.

### M3: Implement `LATERAL JOIN` support for PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL supports `LATERAL JOIN` which allows subqueries in `FROM` to reference columns from preceding tables. Add `lateral_join` and `lateral_left_join` methods to `QueryDsl`, implement the query fragment for PostgreSQL's `PgQueryBuilder`, and add the necessary type-level machinery in `query_builder/select_statement/`.

### M4: Add standalone `diesel migration diff` subcommand to `diesel_cli`

The `diesel_cli` exposes schema-diff functionality only as a flag (`--diff-schema`) on the `diesel migration generate` subcommand, via `diesel_cli/src/migrations/diff_schema.rs`. Add a dedicated `diesel migration diff` subcommand in `diesel_cli/src/cli.rs` and `diesel_cli/src/migrations/mod.rs` that prints a human-readable report of tables, columns, indices, and type mismatches between the live database and the `schema.rs` file without generating migration files. Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with instructions for using `diesel migration diff` to validate schema changes before committing.

### M5: Add backend-specific custom health check support to the r2d2 pool integration

The `r2d2.rs` module implements `ManageConnection` for `ConnectionManager<T>` using the `R2D2Connection` trait. The `is_valid()` implementation unconditionally calls `ping()` which executes a fixed backend-specific query. Extend `R2D2Connection` with a `CustomizeConnection` callback trait that lets users supply an arbitrary validation query and post-connect setup closure (e.g. setting `search_path` for PostgreSQL or `PRAGMA journal_mode` for SQLite). Wire the callback into `is_valid()` and `on_acquire()` so each backend's settings are checked and restored on every connection handout. Implement the callback for `PgConnection`, `MysqlConnection`, and `SqliteConnection` in their respective backend modules and update `r2d2.rs`.

### M6: Add MySQL `FULLTEXT` search expression support

MySQL supports `MATCH(columns) AGAINST(expr IN BOOLEAN MODE)` for full-text search, a backend-specific expression with no equivalent in PostgreSQL or SQLite. Add a `match_against` DSL method for MySQL: define `MatchAgainst` and its search mode enum (`NaturalLanguage`, `Boolean`, `QueryExpansion`) in a new `diesel/src/mysql/expression/` module, implement `QueryFragment<Mysql>` for the expression, expose it via `MysqlExpressionMethods` in `diesel/src/mysql/expression/expression_methods.rs`, add corresponding helper types, and re-export from `diesel/src/mysql/mod.rs`. Changes touch `mysql/expression/`, `mysql/mod.rs`, and expression helper infrastructure.

### M7: Implement compile-time query validation for `diesel_dynamic_schema`

The `diesel_dynamic_schema` crate allows runtime-defined tables and columns but provides no validation. Add an optional compile-time validator that checks dynamic schema definitions against a cached database schema snapshot. Store the schema snapshot in a JSON file, add a CLI command to refresh it, and validate at build time via a proc macro.

### M8: Add support for PostgreSQL advisory locks in the transaction manager

Implement `pg_advisory_lock`, `pg_try_advisory_lock`, and `pg_advisory_unlock` functions that integrate with `AnsiTransactionManager`. Ensure advisory locks are properly tracked and released on transaction rollback. Add them as methods on `PgConnection` and implement the corresponding SQL generation.

### M9: Implement typed PostgreSQL `COPY TO` with column selection

The existing `CopyToBuffer` in `pg/connection/copy.rs` reads raw bytes. Implement a typed `COPY TO` interface that deserializes rows into Rust structs using `Queryable` derivation. Support column selection (not just `*`), CSV and binary formats, and streaming iteration via the `Iterator` trait.

### M10: Add stored procedure and function call support

Diesel supports `define_sql_function!` for SQL scalar functions in expressions but not `CALL` for stored procedures or standalone procedure invocation. Implement a `call_procedure` DSL function that generates `CALL proc_name(args)` for MySQL/PostgreSQL and handles output parameters. Add return type mapping for functions that return tables.

### M11: Extend CI workflow and Docker Compose setup for full cross-database integration testing

The repository already has a `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL and MySQL services, a `docker/` directory with backend initialization scripts, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a multi-backend matrix. However, the CI pipeline installs databases via system packages rather than using `docker-compose.yml`, so the two setups are not kept in sync. Refactor `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use `docker-compose.yml` for the Linux job matrix (PostgreSQL and MySQL), add an SQLite service container entry to `docker-compose.yml`, align the environment variable names in `.env.sample` with those used in CI, and update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with a Docker-based local development setup guide that matches what CI does.

## Wide

### W1: Implement async connection support across all backends

Add an async connection trait `AsyncConnection` alongside the existing sync `Connection` trait. Implement async versions of `PgConnection`, `MysqlConnection`, and `SqliteConnection` using tokio-postgres, mysql_async, and tokio-rusqlite respectively. Share query builder infrastructure between sync and async paths. Changes span `connection/`, all three backend modules, `r2d2.rs`, and `query_dsl/`.

### W2: Add database-level change tracking and event notification system

Implement a change tracking system that captures INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations and notifies subscribers. For PostgreSQL use `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, for MySQL use binlog-like polling, and for SQLite use `update_hook`. Add a `ChangeEvent` type, subscription API, and integrate with the connection lifecycle. Changes span all three backends, connection management, and add a new `events/` module.

### W3: Implement cross-database query federation

Add the ability to join queries across different database backends (e.g., PostgreSQL table joined with SQLite table). Implement a `FederatedConnection` that holds multiple backend connections, a query planner that splits cross-backend queries into backend-local subqueries, and a result merger. Changes span `connection/`, `query_builder/`, `query_dsl/`, and add a federation module.

### W4: Add automatic schema migration generation from Rust struct changes

Implement a `diesel migration generate-from-diff` command that compares Rust model structs (annotated with `#[derive(Queryable)]`) against the current schema and generates migration SQL. Detect added/removed columns, type changes, new tables, and index modifications. Changes span `diesel_cli`, `diesel_derives` (to extract struct metadata), `diesel_migrations`, and schema inference.

### W5: Implement query result caching with automatic invalidation

Add a query result cache layer that stores query results in memory and automatically invalidates them when the cached table is modified via Diesel. Track which tables are read by each cached query and which tables are written by mutations. Changes span `connection/`, `query_builder/` (mutation tracking), `query_dsl/` (cache API), and add a `cache/` module.

### W6: Add comprehensive database testing framework

Implement a `diesel::testing` module with test transaction isolation, automatic schema setup/teardown, fixture loading from TOML/JSON, factory pattern for generating test data, and database state snapshots for assertions. Support all three backends. Changes span `connection/`, `migration/`, and add a new `testing/` module with backend-specific implementations.

### W7: Implement row-level security policy management for PostgreSQL

Add support for defining and managing PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies through Diesel. Implement `enable_rls`, `create_policy`, `alter_policy`, `drop_policy` DSL functions. Add a `CurrentUser` expression type that maps to `current_user`. Integrate with connection setup so policies are automatically applied. Changes span `pg/query_builder/`, `pg/connection/`, `expression/`, migrations, and CLI.

### W8: Add GraphQL-to-Diesel query translation layer

Implement a module that translates GraphQL queries into Diesel query builder calls. Parse GraphQL field selections into `select()` calls, filters into `filter()` chains, nested objects into `inner_join`/`left_join`, and pagination into `limit`/`offset`. Changes span `query_dsl/`, `query_builder/`, `expression/`, `associations/`, and add a `graphql/` translation module.

### W9: Implement multi-tenant data isolation at the ORM level

Add tenant-aware query building that automatically injects tenant ID filters on all queries and sets tenant ID on all inserts. Support PostgreSQL RLS integration, MySQL database-per-tenant, and SQLite file-per-tenant strategies. Changes span `query_builder/` (filter injection), `connection/` (tenant context), all three backends, `diesel_derives` (tenant-aware derives), and migrations.

### W10: Add database schema versioning and compatibility checking system

Implement a schema registry that tracks schema versions, validates application compatibility with the current database schema, and supports blue-green deployment scenarios. Add schema fingerprinting, compatibility matrices, and automatic migration path computation. Changes span `diesel_cli` (registry commands), `diesel_migrations` (version tracking), `connection/` (compatibility check on connect), and add a `schema_registry/` module.

### W11: Overhaul contributor documentation and developer guides

Restructure the project's non-code documentation: consolidate `guide_drafts/` drafts (README.md, backend_installation.md, custom_types.md, migration_guide.md, trait_derives.md) into published documentation linked from `README.md`; update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with build instructions for all three backends using `docker-compose.yml`; add architecture decision records in a new `docs/adr/` directory; update `code_of_conduct.md` to the latest Contributor Covenant version; and add a `RELEASING.md` with the release workflow referencing `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Changes span `guide_drafts/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, `code_of_conduct.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.github/workflows/`.
