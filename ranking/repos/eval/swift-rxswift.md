## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix `throttle` operator dropping the last element when using `.latest` mode

The `ThrottleSink` in `Observables/Throttle.swift` schedules a timer on `next` events but when the source completes while a throttle window is active, the pending latest value is never forwarded. The `on(.completed)` path disposes the scheduled item without flushing it.

### N2: Fix `ReplaySubject` not trimming buffer after `bufferSize` exceeded under concurrent access

In `Subjects/ReplaySubject.swift`, the replay buffer (`ReplayBufferBase`) trims elements in `_synchronized_on`, but concurrent subscriptions can read the un-trimmed buffer between the append and trim, causing subscribers to receive more elements than `bufferSize` specifies.

### N3: Fix `DisposeBag` not thread-safe when calling `insert` during `deinit`

`Disposables/DisposeBag.swift` uses a lock in `insert(_:)` but the `deinit` path calls `dispose()` without holding the lock, creating a race if another thread is inserting a disposable concurrently with bag deallocation.

### N4: Add `distinctUntilChanged` overload accepting `KeyPath` for `Infallible`

The `Infallible` trait in `Traits/Infallible/Infallible+Operators.swift` forwards most operators from `Observable` but lacks a `distinctUntilChanged` variant that accepts a `KeyPath<Element, V>` for property-based comparison, unlike the base `ObservableType` extension.

### N5: Fix `HistoricalScheduler` not advancing clock on `sleep` call

In `Schedulers/HistoricalScheduler.swift`, the `sleep(_:)` method should advance the virtual clock by the specified duration, but it currently calls the superclass `VirtualTimeScheduler.sleep` which is a no-op, preventing time-based operators from progressing in test scenarios.

### N6: Fix `window` operator not completing inner observable on source error

In `Observables/Window.swift`, when the source observable errors, the `WindowTimeCountSink` disposes the timer and forwards the error to the outer observable, but the current inner `Subject` never receives a `.completed` or `.error` event, leaving subscribers hanging.

### N7: Add `timeout` operator variant for `Maybe` trait

The `PrimitiveSequence` extensions in `Traits/PrimitiveSequence/PrimitiveSequence.swift` expose `timeout` for `Single` and `Completable` but the `Maybe` type is missing a `timeout` overload, requiring users to convert to `Observable` and back.

### N8: Fix `sample` operator emitting duplicate values when trigger fires rapidly

In `Observables/Sample.swift`, the `SampleSequenceSink` stores the latest value and a `hasValue` flag, but when the sampler fires multiple times before a new source value arrives, the same value is emitted repeatedly because `hasValue` is not cleared after emission when `onlyNew` is not available.

### N9: Fix `CurrentThreadScheduler` recursive scheduling causing stack overflow

In `Schedulers/CurrentThreadScheduler.swift`, recursive `schedule` calls within a scheduled action queue work items into the current thread's queue, but deeply nested recursive scheduling causes unbounded stack growth because the trampoline re-enters before the queue drains.

### N10: Add `materialize` operator for `Completable` trait

The `Completable` extensions in `Traits/PrimitiveSequence/Completable.swift` lack a `materialize()` operator that would convert `.completed` and `.error` events into `Observable<CompletableEvent>`, unlike `Single` and `Maybe` which have their own materialized event types.

## Medium

### M1: Implement `share(replay:scope:)` for `Infallible`

The `Infallible` trait needs a `share(replay:scope:)` operator equivalent to `Observable.share(replay:scope:)` in `Observables/ShareReplayScope.swift`. This requires adapting `ShareReplay1WhileConnected` and `ShareReplayLifetimeScope` to work with the `InfallibleType` protocol while preserving the no-error guarantee.

### M2: Add retry with exponential backoff operator

Implement a `retry(maxAttempts:delay:multiplier:scheduler:)` operator that retries a failed observable sequence with configurable exponential backoff. The operator should integrate with `RetryWhen` logic in `Observables/RetryWhen.swift` and schedulers for delay timing without blocking threads.

### M3: Implement `TestScheduler` cold observable auto-disposal tracking

Extend `RxTest/Schedulers/TestScheduler.swift` to track all subscriptions created by `createColdObservable` and provide an assertion method `assertAllDisposed(by:)` that verifies all subscriptions are disposed by a specific virtual time. This requires extending `TestableObservable` and `Subscription` tracking.

### M4: Add `combineLatest` collection operator for `Infallible`

The `Infallible` trait lacks the collection-based `combineLatest` available in `Observables/CombineLatest+Collection.swift`. Implement `Infallible.combineLatest(_ collection:resultSelector:)` that combines an arbitrary collection of `Infallible` sequences while maintaining the infallible guarantee.

### M5: Implement `prefetch` operator for observable sequences

Add a `prefetch(count:)` operator that eagerly subscribes and buffers up to `count` elements before the downstream subscribes. This requires a new file in `Observables/` with a custom `Producer` subclass, buffer management with proper back-pressure, and scheduler-aware element delivery.

### M6: Add debug name propagation through operator chains

Extend the `debug()` operator in `Observables/Debug.swift` to support propagating debug identifiers through chained operators. Each operator in the chain should inherit and append its operator name to a debug path (e.g., `"source > map > filter > throttle"`), with the path accessible in `Rx.resources` for leak debugging.

### M7: Implement `RxBlocking` timeout with partial results

Extend `RxBlocking/BlockingObservable+Operators.swift` to add `toArray(timeout:partial:)` that returns elements collected before the timeout instead of throwing. This requires modifying `BlockingObservable`'s `RunLoopLock` integration to support partial result collection and adding new error types for timeout-with-partial-data.

### M8: Add `BehaviorRelay` snapshot and diff support

Extend `RxRelay/BehaviorRelay.swift` with `snapshot()` returning the current value and subscription count, and `changes()` returning an `Observable` that emits `(oldValue, newValue)` tuples. Requires adding value comparison infrastructure and thread-safe old value tracking within the relay.

### M9: Implement scheduler-aware `delay` for `Completable` trait

The `Completable` trait lacks a `delay` operator. Implement `delay(_:scheduler:)` in `Traits/PrimitiveSequence/Completable.swift` that delays the `.completed` event by the specified duration using the provided scheduler, correctly handling disposal during the delay window and error passthrough.

### M10: Add `groupBy` operator support for `Driver` trait

The `Driver` trait in `RxCocoa/Traits/` supports most operators but lacks `groupBy`. Implement `Driver.groupBy(keySelector:)` that returns `Driver<GroupedObservable<Key, Element>>`, ensuring all emissions happen on the main scheduler and errors are replaced with the `onErrorJustReturn` recovery mechanism.

## Wide

### W1: Implement structured concurrency bridge for async/await

Add comprehensive `async`/`await` bridging beyond the existing `Observable+Concurrency.swift`. Implement `AsyncObservableSequence` conforming to `AsyncSequence`, `Observable.init(asyncSequence:)` for the reverse direction, `Subject.send(from:)` for async stream feeding, and `Task`-aware disposal that cancels the RxSwift subscription when the Task is cancelled. Changes span RxSwift/Concurrency/, Observable, Subjects, and DisposeBag.

### W2: Implement reactive caching layer with expiration

Add a `CachedObservable` type that wraps a source observable with configurable TTL, max-size LRU caching, and cache invalidation. Support cache key extraction via `KeyPath`, shared cache across multiple subscribers, cache prewarming, and disk persistence. Changes span new files in RxSwift/Observables/, extensions to `ObservableType`, new data structures in Platform/, and integration with schedulers for TTL expiration.

### W3: Add comprehensive operator fusion optimization

Implement operator fusion that detects and optimizes common operator chain patterns: `map.map` → single `map`, `filter.filter` → single `filter`, `observeOn.observeOn` → last `observeOn`, and `share().share()` → single `share()`. Requires modifying `Producer` in `Observables/Producer.swift`, adding a fusion protocol to `Sink`, and updating `Map`, `Filter`, `ObserveOn`, and `ShareReplayScope` to participate in fusion.

### W4: Implement distributed tracing for operator chains

Add tracing infrastructure that tracks element flow through operator chains: timestamp at each operator, processing duration, back-pressure metrics, and subscription lifecycle events. Requires adding a `Tracer` protocol, tracing hooks in `Producer.subscribe`, `Sink.forwardOn`, and `Disposable.dispose`, a `TracingScheduler` wrapper, and a reporting API. Changes span Observables/, Schedulers/, Disposables/, and new tracing module.

### W5: Add reactive state management framework

Implement `RxStore<State, Action>` as a Redux-like state container built on RxSwift: a `store.dispatch(action:)` that feeds through a `reduce(state:action:)` function, middleware support via observable transforms, `select(keyPath:)` for derived state streams with `distinctUntilChanged`, and time-travel debugging via `ReplaySubject`. Changes span new module files, integration with Subjects, operators, and RxCocoa for UI binding.

### W6: Implement comprehensive memory leak detection

Add a `LeakDetector` that tracks all RxSwift resource allocations and detects common leak patterns: retained `DisposeBag` in closures, missing disposal of subscriptions, circular references through `withLatestFrom`, and `share()` keeping upstream alive after all subscribers disconnect. Requires instrumenting `DisposeBag`, `Producer.subscribe`, `Sink`, `SubjectType`, and adding leak reporting to the `Resources` tracking system.

### W7: Add RxTest assertion DSL for complex sequence verification

Implement a fluent assertion API for `TestScheduler`: `expect(observer).toEmit([.next(200, "a"), .completed(300)])`, `expect(observable).toSubscribe(at: 200).andDispose(at: 500)`, `expect(hotObservable).toHaveSubscribers(count: 2, at: 300)`. Requires extending `TestableObserver`, `TestableObservable`, `Subscription`, adding custom assertion failure reporting, and integration with XCTest.

### W8: Implement cross-platform scheduler abstraction

Replace platform-specific scheduler implementations with a unified `SchedulerProvider` protocol supporting custom event loops. Implement providers for GCD (`DispatchQueue`), `OperationQueue`, Linux `epoll`, and a configurable thread pool. Requires refactoring `SerialDispatchQueueScheduler`, `ConcurrentDispatchQueueScheduler`, `MainScheduler`, Platform/ abstractions, and adding a provider registry.

### W9: Add backpressure support to observable sequences

Implement a backpressure mechanism for `Observable` sequences: `Flowable<Element>` type with `request(count:)` demand signaling, backpressure strategies (buffer, drop, latest, error), and integration with existing operators. Requires new protocol `FlowableType`, modifications to `Producer`/`Sink` for demand tracking, backpressure-aware versions of `Merge`, `FlatMap`, `Zip`, `CombineLatest`, and bridging operators between `Observable` and `Flowable`.

### W10: Implement reactive networking layer in RxCocoa

Extend `RxCocoa/Foundation/URLSession+Rx.swift` into a full reactive networking module: request retry with backoff, response caching with observable invalidation, request deduplication for identical in-flight requests, progress tracking as `Observable<Progress>`, multipart upload support, and automatic JSON decoding with `Codable`. Changes span RxCocoa/Foundation/, new networking files, integration with schedulers for retry timing, and RxSwift operators for deduplication logic.

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in mise.toml

The project configuration file `mise.toml` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in mise.toml, and update docs/undocumented.json to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `mise.toml`, `.swiftlint.yml`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
