## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix `test.each` not preserving test context when used with fixtures

When `test.each(cases)` is combined with fixture injection via `test.extend`, the fixtures are not injected into the parameterized test function. The `collect.ts` in `packages/runner/src/` doesn't propagate fixture definitions through `each` wrappers.

### N2: Fix snapshot update mode not clearing obsolete snapshots from inline snapshot files

When running with `--update`, removed inline snapshots in test files leave stale `toMatchInlineSnapshot()` calls with old values. The `InlineSnapshotManager` in `packages/snapshot/src/port/inlineSnapshot.ts` detects unused file-based snapshots but skips inline ones.

### N3: Add `--fail-on-flaky` CLI flag to mark flaky tests as failures

When a test passes on retry after initially failing, it's reported as passed. Add a CLI flag that treats retried-then-passed tests as failures. Changes touch `packages/vitest/src/node/cli/` for the flag and `packages/runner/src/run.ts` for retry result handling.

### N4: Fix `vi.useFakeTimers()` not affecting `setTimeout` inside `Promise.then` chains

When fake timers are active, `setTimeout` calls inside resolved promise `.then()` callbacks use real timers because the microtask runs after the fake timer context is restored. The timer installation in `packages/vitest/src/integrations/vi.ts` doesn't intercept microtask-scheduled timers.

### N5: Fix coverage report showing 0% for files that only export types

When a TypeScript file exports only type definitions, V8 coverage reports it as 0% covered even though there's no executable code. The coverage provider in `packages/coverage-v8/src/provider.ts` should exclude type-only files from the coverage report.

### N6: Add `expect.soft()` assertion that collects failures without stopping the test

Currently `expect()` throws on first failure. Add `expect.soft()` that records failures and reports all of them at test end. Changes touch `packages/expect/src/jest-expect.ts` for the soft wrapper and `packages/runner/src/run.ts` for failure collection.

### N7: Fix `toMatchObject` not handling `Date` instances correctly in deep comparisons

When `expect(obj).toMatchObject({ date: new Date('2024-01-01') })` compares objects with `Date` fields, it uses reference equality instead of value equality. The comparison logic in `packages/expect/src/jest-utils.ts` doesn't special-case `Date` objects.

### N8: Fix test file watcher not detecting changes in symlinked dependencies

When test files import from symlinked local packages, changes to those packages don't trigger re-runs. The watcher in `packages/vitest/src/node/watcher.ts` resolves symlinks but doesn't add the resolved paths to the watch list.

### N9: Add `onTestFinished` hook for cleanup that runs after each test regardless of result

Tests need a way to register cleanup callbacks that run after the test completes (pass or fail), similar to Go's `t.Cleanup()`. Add `onTestFinished(callback)` to the test context in `packages/runner/src/context.ts` with execution in `packages/runner/src/run.ts`.

### N10: Fix `vi.mock()` hoisting not working with dynamic import expressions

When `vi.mock('./module')` is used alongside `const mod = await import('./module')`, the mock factory isn't applied because the hoisting transform in `packages/vitest/src/node/plugins/` doesn't intercept dynamic `import()` calls following `vi.mock()`.

### N11: Update CLI documentation for the `--fail-on-flaky` flag

The `--fail-on-flaky` CLI flag is undocumented. Add usage examples and behavior description to `docs/guide/cli.md`. Update `docs/guide/filtering.md` with flaky test handling guidance. Add a configuration reference entry in `docs/config/retry.md` covering the interaction between retry settings and flaky detection.

## Medium

### M1: Implement test tagging and tag-based filtering

Add `test.tag('slow', 'integration')` and `--tags slow --exclude-tags integration` CLI filtering. Changes span `packages/runner/src/collect.ts` for tag collection, `packages/vitest/src/node/tags.ts` for filtering, `packages/vitest/src/node/cli/` for CLI options, and reporter output. Update `docs/guide/test-tags.md` and `docs/config/tags.md` with tag filtering documentation, configuration reference, and usage examples.

### M2: Add parallel suite execution within a single test file

Currently suites within a file run sequentially. Implement `describe.concurrent()` that runs child suites in parallel with configurable concurrency limits. Changes span `packages/runner/src/run.ts` for parallel suite orchestration, `packages/runner/src/collect.ts` for concurrent marking, and `packages/runner/src/fixture.ts` for fixture isolation.

### M3: Implement snapshot testing with custom serializers per test file

Add the ability to register custom snapshot serializers scoped to a test file via `vi.snapshotSerializer(serializer)`. Changes span `packages/snapshot/src/client.ts` for per-file serializer storage, `packages/snapshot/src/port/state.ts` for state tracking, and `packages/vitest/src/integrations/snapshot/` for the API.

### M4: Add test dependency declaration and ordering

Implement `test.dependsOn('other test name')` that ensures a test only runs after its dependency passes. Detect circular dependencies and skip dependents when a dependency fails. Changes span `packages/runner/src/collect.ts` for dependency graph, `packages/runner/src/run.ts` for ordered execution, and `packages/vitest/src/node/sequencers/`.

### M5: Implement automatic test retry with exponential backoff

Extend the retry mechanism to support `retry: { count: 3, delay: 1000, backoff: 'exponential' }`. Changes span `packages/runner/src/run.ts` for retry scheduling with delays, `packages/vitest/src/node/config/resolveConfig.ts` for config options, and type definitions.

### M6: Add module mock validation to detect unmocked imports

Implement `vi.mock('./module', { strict: true })` that throws when the test code accesses a property not explicitly defined in the mock factory. Changes span `packages/mocker/src/automocker.ts` for proxy-based strict mocking, `packages/mocker/src/registry.ts` for mock tracking, and `packages/vitest/src/integrations/mock/`.

### M7: Implement coverage diff reporting against a baseline

Add `--coverage-baseline coverage-baseline.json` that compares current coverage against a saved baseline and reports regressions. Changes span `packages/coverage-v8/src/provider.ts` and `packages/coverage-istanbul/src/` for baseline loading and comparison, and `packages/vitest/src/node/coverage.ts` for orchestration.

### M8: Add structured test metadata and custom properties

Implement `test.meta({ ticket: 'JIRA-123', owner: 'team-a' })` that attaches metadata to test results, available in reporters and the UI. Changes span `packages/runner/src/types.ts` for metadata types, `packages/runner/src/collect.ts`, `packages/vitest/src/node/reporters/` for output, and `packages/ui/` for display.

### M9: Implement global test setup/teardown with resource sharing

Add `globalSetup` files that can export resources accessible to all test files via `inject()`. Changes span `packages/vitest/src/node/globalSetup.ts` for resource lifecycle, `packages/vitest/src/integrations/inject.ts` for type-safe access, and `packages/vitest/src/node/pools/` for resource propagation across workers.

### M10: Add test file impact analysis using module graph

Implement `--changed` mode that uses the Vite module graph to determine which test files are affected by source changes, running only impacted tests. Changes span `packages/vitest/src/node/git.ts` for change detection, `packages/vitest/src/node/vite.ts` for module graph traversal, and `packages/vitest/src/node/specifications.ts` for test selection.

### M11: Add contributor documentation and CI validation for test tagging

Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with tag system development guidelines and architecture overview. Add advanced tag filtering examples to `docs/guide/test-tags.md` covering tag composition and exclusion patterns. Update tag-related configuration documentation in `docs/config/tags.md` with all available options. Add a CI validation job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs the tag-filtered test suite.
