## Why this repo

- **Expression-tree mapping pipeline**: Compiles mapping plans to expression trees at configuration time, separate validation, execution, and projection phases
- **Well-structured**: Clear separation between Configuration/, Execution/, Mappers/, QueryableExtensions/, Internal/, Licensing/
- **Rich feature surface**: Profiles, conventions, annotations, reverse maps, path maps, flattening, value transformers, IQueryable projections

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix `ReverseMap` not honoring `ForPath` mappings

When a `TypeMapConfiguration` declares `ForPath(dest => dest.Address.City, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.City))` and then calls `ReverseMap()`, the reverse map does not generate the correct source expression for the nested path. The `PathMap` entries are skipped when `MappingExpression.ReverseMapExpression` iterates `PathMaps` in `TypeMapConfiguration`.

### N2: Fix `NullsafeQueryRewriter` dropping method-call arguments for parameterised projections

In `QueryableExtensions/NullsafeQueryRewriter.cs`, when the projection tree contains a `MethodCallExpression` whose arguments themselves contain member accesses on nullable navigations, the rewriter wraps the receiver but does not recursively visit the argument sub-expressions, producing an invalid expression tree that throws at query execution.

### N3: Fix `ConfigurationValidator` not reporting unmapped `PathMap` members

`ConfigurationValidator.Validate` checks `PropertyMaps` for unresolved mappings but skips `PathMaps`. When a `ForPath` target references a destination member that does not exist, `AssertConfigurationIsValid()` passes without error instead of reporting the invalid path.

### N4: Fix `CollectionMapper` not preserving existing destination list when `UseDestinationValue` is set

In `Mappers/CollectionMapper.cs`, `MapCollection` clears and repopulates the destination collection even when the member map has `UseExistingValue = true`. The mapper should merge items into the existing collection rather than replacing it.

### N5: Add `[MapAtRuntime]` annotation support for constructor parameters

The `Annotations/MapAtRuntimeAttribute.cs` is defined and works for property members, but `ConstructorMap.ApplyAnnotations` in `ConstructorMap.cs` does not scan constructor parameter attributes, so runtime-resolved constructor parameters cannot be declared via the attribute.

### N6: Fix `EnumToEnumMapper` not handling `[Flags]` composite values

`Mappers/EnumToEnumMapper.cs` only maps single enum values through `Enum.ToObject`. When the source value is a bitwise combination of flags, the mapper produces an invalid destination value because it does not decompose and re-compose flag bits for enums whose underlying names differ.

### N7: Fix `LockingConcurrentDictionary` potential deadlock under recursive `GetOrAdd`

In `Internal/LockingConcurrentDictionary.cs`, `GetOrAdd` acquires a lock per bucket-hash. If the value factory itself triggers another `GetOrAdd` on the same dictionary with a key that hashes to the same bucket, the thread deadlocks on the same `Lock` instance.

### N8: Fix `ProxyGenerator` not forwarding interface default method implementations

`Execution/ProxyGenerator.cs` generates proxy types that implement interfaces but only creates stub properties. When the destination interface has default method implementations (C# 8+), calling those methods on the proxy throws `NotImplementedException` because the generated type does not inherit the interface defaults.

### N9: Fix `ObjectFactory` ignoring parameterless private constructors

`Execution/ObjectFactory.cs` uses `ConstructorInfo` lookups filtered to public constructors. If the only parameterless constructor is private or internal, `ObjectFactory` falls through to `FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject`, bypassing any logic in the private constructor. It should respect `BindingFlags.NonPublic` when `CreateUsingServiceLocatorOrDefault` is invoked with `allowPrivate: true`.

### N10: Fix `TypeMapPlanBuilder` not emitting null-check for value-type source with `Nullable<T>` wrapper

In `Execution/TypeMapPlanBuilder.cs`, when building the map expression for `Nullable<T> → T`, the builder does not insert a `HasValue` guard. If the source is `null`, the compiled delegate throws `InvalidOperationException` instead of returning `default(T)` or applying the configured null substitution.

## Medium

### M1: Add inheritance-chain mapping with automatic base-type map inclusion

When mapping `DerivedSrc → DerivedDest`, AutoMapper must currently have an explicit map for the pair. Implement automatic inclusion of base-type maps so that `CreateMap<BaseSource, BaseDest>()` automatically applies to derived pairs when the destination type hierarchy mirrors the source. Changes span `MapperConfiguration.Seal`, `TypeMapConfiguration`, `ProfileMap.BuildTypeMap`, and `TypeMapPlanBuilder`.

### M2: Implement bidirectional collection synchronization for `ReverseMap`

When `ReverseMap` is used with collection members (e.g., `List<ChildDto> → List<Child>`), the current reverse mapping creates new destination collection elements instead of matching by key and updating in place. Implement key-based matching using a configurable `EqualityComparison` on `MappingExpression`, applied during `CollectionMapper` execution and wired through `ReverseMapExpression`.

### M3: Add mapping diagnostic trace for debugging complex type maps

Implement a `MapperConfiguration.BuildExecutionPlan(typeof(Src), typeof(Dest))` diagnostic that returns a human-readable tree of the compiled mapping plan: source member → destination member, value resolvers applied, type converters, conditions, and null substitutions. Changes span `TypeMapPlanBuilder`, `ExpressionBuilder`, `ProfileMap`, and a new `DiagnosticPlan` model.

### M4: Implement conditional profile activation based on runtime context

Add `Profile.When(Func<ResolutionContext, bool> predicate)` that activates or deactivates an entire profile's type maps at mapping time. Requires changes to `ProfileMap`, `MapperConfiguration.GetTypeMap`, `ResolutionContext`, and the plan builder to insert conditional branching expressions.

### M5: Add `ProjectTo<T>` support for `GroupBy` and aggregate projections

`QueryableExtensions/ProjectionBuilder.cs` currently only handles flat `Select` projections. Implement support for projecting grouped results where destination properties map to aggregate functions (`Count`, `Sum`, `Average`). Changes span `ProjectionBuilder`, add `AggregateProjectionMapper` in `ProjectionMappers/`, and extend `MappingExpression` with `.ForAggregate()`.

### M6: Implement mapping plan caching with invalidation for mutable configurations

`MapperConfiguration` rebuilds all type maps on `Seal()`. Add lazy per-`TypePair` plan caching in `ProfileMap` using the existing `LockingConcurrentDictionary`, with cache invalidation when `Features` change or an `IObjectMapper` is added. Changes span `ProfileMap`, `TypeMap`, `TypeMapPlanBuilder`, and `LockingConcurrentDictionary`.

### M7: Add annotation-driven value converter discovery

Extend the annotation system to support `[ValueConverter(typeof(MyConverter))]` on destination properties for automatic converter wiring. Requires changes to `Configuration/Annotations/ValueConverterAttribute.cs`, `TypeMapConfiguration.ApplyAnnotations`, `MappingExpression`, and `PropertyMap` to resolve and apply converters from attributes during configuration.

### M8: Implement `Map<TDest>(object source)` with runtime source-type resolution and caching

The current `Mapper.Map<TDest>(object source)` does a runtime type lookup every call. Implement a fast-path cache in `Mapper` using `TypePair` keyed on `source.GetType() → typeof(TDest)`, with fallback to the existing `FindTypeMapFor` resolution. Changes span `Mapper.cs`, `ResolutionContext`, and `ProfileMap.GetTypeMap`.

### M9: Add mapping interceptors (before-map / after-map) at the profile level

`MappingExpression` supports `BeforeMap` and `AfterMap` per type map. Implement profile-level interceptors that apply to all maps within a profile. Changes span `Profile`, `ProfileMap`, `TypeMapPlanBuilder` (to insert interceptor expressions), and `MappingExpression`.

### M10: Implement source-member auditing to detect unused source properties

Add `MapperConfiguration.FindUnmappedSourceMembers(typeof(Src), typeof(Dest))` that returns source properties not consumed by any `PropertyMap`, `PathMap`, or `ConstructorMap`. Changes span `TypeMap` (to track consumed source members), `ConfigurationValidator`, and expose via `MapperConfiguration`.

## Wide

### W1: Implement compiled mapping code generation with source-generator support

Replace the runtime expression-tree compilation pipeline with an optional Roslyn source generator that emits mapping methods at build time. Requires a new `AutoMapper.SourceGeneration` project, modifications to `TypeMapPlanBuilder` to output C# syntax trees instead of expression trees, changes to `MapperConfiguration` to load generated mappers, and DI registration updates in `ServiceCollectionExtensions`.

### W2: Add polymorphic mapping with discriminator-based type resolution

Implement `CreateMap<Base, BaseDto>().IncludeAllDerived().DiscriminateBy(src => src.Type)` that automatically selects the correct derived type map based on a discriminator value. Changes span `TypeMapConfiguration`, `ProfileMap` type-map lookup, `MapperConfiguration.Seal` (to build discriminator tables), `TypeMapPlanBuilder` (to emit switch expressions), and `ResolutionContext`.

### W3: Implement full IQueryable projection pipeline with Include/ThenInclude support

Extend the `QueryableExtensions` to emit EF Core `Include`/`ThenInclude` calls based on mapped navigation properties. Requires changes to `ProjectionBuilder` (to detect navigation properties and emit include chains), `NullsafeQueryRewriter` (to preserve include expressions), `ProfileMap` (to expose navigation metadata), and new `IncludeProjectionMapper` in `ProjectionMappers/`.

### W4: Add multi-target mapping with fan-out and fan-in support

Implement `CreateMap<Source, (TargetA, TargetB)>()` that maps a single source to multiple destination objects, and `CreateMap<(SourceA, SourceB), Target>()` for combining multiple sources. Changes span `TypeMapConfiguration`, `MappingExpression`, `TypeMap`, `Mapper.Map`, `TypeMapPlanBuilder` expression generation, and `ResolutionContext` to carry tuple-typed destinations.

### W5: Implement mapping versioning and migration for schema evolution

Add version-aware mapping where `CreateMap<Src, Dest>().Version(2)` can coexist with prior versions. `Mapper.Map(source, version: 1)` selects the correct type map. Requires changes to `MapperConfiguration`, `ProfileMap`, `TypeMap` (to store version), `ResolutionContext` (to carry version), `TypeMapPlanBuilder`, and `Mapper`.

### W6: Add real-time mapping performance profiling and diagnostics

Implement an `IMapperDiagnostics` interface exposing per-type-map execution counts, average duration, expression-tree compilation time, and cache hit rates. Requires instrumentation in `Mapper.Map`, `ResolutionContext`, `TypeMapPlanBuilder` compilation, `LockingConcurrentDictionary` cache operations, and a new `Diagnostics/` module with `MapperDiagnosticsCollector`.

### W7: Implement async mapping pipeline for I/O-bound value resolvers

Add `MapAsync<TDest>(source)` that supports `IAsyncValueResolver` and `IAsyncTypeConverter`. Requires async versions of `Mapper`, `ResolutionContext`, `TypeMapPlanBuilder` (to emit async/await expression trees), `MappingExpression` (for `ResolveUsing<IAsyncValueResolver>`), and `CollectionMapper` (for parallel async element mapping).

### W8: Add cross-profile circular reference handling with identity map

Implement an identity map in `ResolutionContext` that tracks already-mapped source objects across all type maps to handle circular references. Requires changes to `ResolutionContext` (identity map dictionary), `Mapper.Map` (lookup before mapping), `TypeMapPlanBuilder` (emit identity map checks), `ProfileMap` (configure circular reference depth limit), and `CollectionMapper` (check map for collection elements).

### W9: Implement convention-based mapping with pluggable naming strategies

Extend `Conventions.cs` to support fully pluggable naming strategies beyond the built-in `PascalCase`/`LowerUnderscoreCase`. Add an `INamingConvention` pipeline where multiple naming conventions are composed (prefix stripping, suffix mapping, acronym expansion). Changes span `Conventions`, `INamingConvention`, `ProfileMap.MatchMembers`, `TypeMapConfiguration`, `MemberConfigurationExpression`, and `ConfigurationValidator`.

### W10: Add distributed mapping configuration with remote profile loading

Implement `MapperConfiguration.LoadProfile(Uri endpoint)` that fetches serialized profile definitions from a remote service, deserializes type maps, and merges them into the active configuration. Changes span `MapperConfiguration`, `Profile` (serialization/deserialization), `TypeMapConfiguration`, `ProfileMap`, `ServiceCollectionExtensions` (hot-reload registration), and a new `Remote/` module.

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in .vscode/mcp.json

The project configuration file `.vscode/mcp.json` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in .vscode/mcp.json, and update docs/source/Open-Generics.md to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `.github/workflows/lock.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `docs/source/Open-Generics.md`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
