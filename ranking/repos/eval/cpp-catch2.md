## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix `SECTION` nesting depth not reported in console reporter on failure

When an assertion fails inside a deeply nested `SECTION` in `internal/catch_section.cpp`, the console reporter in `reporters/catch_reporter_console.cpp` only prints the innermost section name. The full section path (parent > child > grandchild) should be displayed to help locate the failure.

### N2: Fix `Approx` matcher not handling subnormal floating-point values correctly

In `matchers/catch_matchers_floating_point.cpp`, the `WithinAbsMatcher` compares using absolute epsilon but does not account for subnormal float values where the default epsilon is larger than the values themselves, causing false positives for comparisons near zero.

### N3: Add `CATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_BENCHMARKS` compile-time flag

The benchmark subsystem in `benchmark/catch_benchmark.hpp` is always compiled even when not used. Add a preprocessor flag in `internal/catch_compiler_capabilities.hpp` that disables benchmark compilation, reducing binary size for projects that only need test assertions.

### N4: Fix JSON reporter not escaping Unicode control characters

In `internal/catch_jsonwriter.cpp`, the JSON string escaping handles quotes and backslashes but does not escape Unicode control characters (U+0000–U+001F) as required by the JSON specification. Characters like `\t` and `\n` embedded in test names produce invalid JSON output.

### N5: Fix `StringRef` comparison not being `constexpr` when possible

In `internal/catch_stringref.hpp`, the `operator==` for `StringRef` performs a length check followed by `std::memcmp`, but neither is marked `constexpr`. Since C++17 allows `constexpr` string operations, the comparison should be `constexpr` for compile-time test name deduplication.

### N6: Add wildcard negation support in test spec tag expressions

The test spec parser in `internal/catch_test_spec_parser.cpp` supports `[tag]` inclusion and `~[tag]` exclusion, but does not support negated wildcard patterns like `~[slow*]` to exclude all tags matching a prefix. The `WildcardPattern` in `internal/catch_wildcard_pattern.hpp` only handles positive matches.

### N7: Fix `TextFlow::Column` not handling embedded ANSI escape codes in width calculation

In `internal/catch_textflow.cpp`, the `Column` text wrapper calculates line width by counting characters, but ANSI color codes (e.g., `\033[31m`) are counted as visible characters, causing lines to wrap too early when the console reporter uses colored output.

### N8: Fix `GENERATE` macro not deterministic across platforms with same seed

In `generators/catch_generators.cpp`, the `GeneratorTracker` uses `std::mt19937` but the generator index tracking varies across platforms due to different `SECTION` evaluation orders, causing `GENERATE(random(...))` to produce different sequences on Linux vs macOS with the same `--rng-seed`.

### N9: Add elapsed time display to TAP reporter output

The TAP reporter in `reporters/catch_reporter_tap.cpp` outputs `ok`/`not ok` lines but does not include execution time for individual test cases. Add `# time=<ms>` directives after each test line, following the TAP 13 specification for timing metadata.

### N10: Fix `catch_sharding.hpp` not distributing tests evenly when count is not divisible by shard count

In `internal/catch_sharding.hpp`, the `createShard` function uses modulo-based distribution that can produce shards with significantly different test counts when the total is not evenly divisible. The last shard may get up to `shard_count - 1` fewer tests than others.

## Medium

### M1: Implement parametrized test case registration

Add `TEST_CASE_P(name, generator)` macro that registers a test case once but runs it for each value produced by a generator. This requires modifying `internal/catch_test_case_registry_impl.cpp` to support parameterized registration, adding parameter display in test names, and ensuring each parameter run is reported independently in all reporters.

### M2: Add `REQUIRE_THROWS_MATCHES` with exception matcher chaining

Implement matcher composition for exception assertions: `REQUIRE_THROWS_MATCHES(expr, ExType, HasMessage("x") && HasCode(42))`. Requires extending the exception matchers in `matchers/catch_matchers_exception.hpp`, adding `HasCode` matcher, and modifying the decomposer in `internal/catch_decomposer.hpp` to support matcher conjunction on exception types.

### M3: Implement test dependency declarations with ordering

Add `TEST_CASE("b", "[depends:a]")` syntax that declares test "b" depends on test "a" completing successfully. Requires modifying the tag parser in `internal/catch_test_spec_parser.cpp`, the test case registry ordering in `internal/catch_test_case_registry_impl.cpp`, and the run context in `internal/catch_run_context.cpp` to skip dependents when their prerequisite fails.

### M4: Add structured key-value output to benchmark results

Extend `benchmark/detail/catch_benchmark_stats.hpp` to support custom key-value metrics alongside timing data. Users should be able to call `BENCHMARK_METRIC("throughput_mbps", value)` within a benchmark, and all reporters should output these custom metrics alongside the standard mean/stddev/outliers.

### M5: Implement parallel section execution within a test case

Add `PARALLEL_SECTION("name")` that allows independent sections within a test case to execute concurrently using `std::thread`. Requires extending the section tracker in `internal/catch_test_case_tracker.cpp`, adding synchronization for assertion reporting in `internal/catch_run_context.cpp`, and ensuring reporters handle interleaved section results correctly.

### M6: Add JUnit reporter support for test suite properties and system-out

Extend `reporters/catch_reporter_junit.cpp` to emit `<properties>` elements from user-defined metadata and capture `<system-out>` / `<system-err>` per test case using the output redirect in `internal/catch_output_redirect.cpp`. Requires adding a metadata API accessible from test cases and integrating it with the JUnit XML writer.

### M7: Implement generator shrinking for property-based testing

Add shrinking support to generators in `generators/catch_generators.hpp`: when a `GENERATE`-based test fails, automatically find a minimal failing input by shrinking the generated value. Requires adding a `Shrinkable<T>` wrapper, a shrink loop in the generator tracker, and integration with the console reporter to display both original and shrunk values.

### M8: Add test retry on failure with configurable attempt limit

Implement `--retry-failed <N>` CLI option that re-runs failed tests up to N times before declaring them as failures. Requires modifying the CLI parser in `internal/catch_commandline.cpp`, the run context loop in `internal/catch_run_context.cpp`, and all reporters to annotate retried tests with attempt numbers and only report the final status.

### M9: Implement custom reporter plugin loading at runtime

Add `--load-reporter <path>` CLI option to dynamically load reporter shared libraries. Requires adding a plugin loader in `internal/`, extending the reporter registry in `internal/catch_reporter_registry.cpp` to support dynamic registration, defining a stable C ABI for reporter plugins, and modifying the CLI parser.

### M10: Add source location tracking for matchers in failure messages

When a matcher assertion fails, the error message shows the expression but not where the matcher was defined. Extend `matchers/catch_matchers.hpp` to capture `std::source_location` at matcher construction, and modify the assertion handler in `internal/catch_assertion_handler.cpp` to include the matcher definition site in the failure output.

## Wide

### W1: Implement snapshot testing framework

Add `CHECK_SNAPSHOT(name, value)` macro that compares serialized values against stored reference files, with `--update-snapshots` flag to regenerate. Requires a new `snapshots/` subsystem for file I/O and diffing, integration with the assertion handler, modifications to all reporters for snapshot diff display, a CLI option in `internal/catch_commandline.cpp`, and a snapshot serialization protocol supporting custom types.

### W2: Add test coverage integration and reporting

Implement built-in coverage tracking that records which `SECTION` and `TEST_CASE` blocks are executed per source file. Add `--coverage-report <path>` CLI option producing an HTML or JSON report. Requires compiler-assisted instrumentation hooks in `internal/catch_run_context.cpp`, a coverage data store, a new coverage reporter in `reporters/`, and integration with the test case registry for mapping tests to source locations.

### W3: Implement distributed test execution with result aggregation

Add `--distribute <worker-count>` mode that splits tests across child processes, executes them in parallel, and aggregates results. Requires a coordinator in `internal/` that uses the sharding logic from `catch_sharding.hpp`, IPC for result collection, modifications to all reporters for merged output, handling of crashed workers, and a unified exit code based on aggregated results.

### W4: Add mocking framework integrated with Catch2 assertions

Implement `MOCK_METHOD(Class, method, ReturnType(Args...))` that creates mock objects verified through Catch2's assertion system. Requires a mock registry parallel to the test registry, expectation recording and verification in `internal/`, automatic mock verification at section/test end via the tracker, integration with matchers for argument matching, and failure reporting through the existing decomposer.

### W5: Implement test execution profiling and bottleneck detection

Add `--profile` mode that tracks timing for each test case, section, assertion, and generator step. Produce a flame-graph-compatible output and a summary of slowest tests. Requires timing instrumentation in `internal/catch_run_context.cpp`, section tracker, generator tracker, a profiling data model, a new profile reporter in `reporters/`, and CLI integration.

### W6: Add data-driven testing with external data sources

Implement `TEST_CASE_DATA("name", "data.csv")` and `TEST_CASE_DATA("name", "data.json")` that load test parameters from external files. Requires CSV/JSON parsers (extending `catch_jsonwriter` for reading), a data-driven test registrar in `internal/`, parameter injection into test functions, per-row reporting in all reporters, and `--data-dir` CLI option for base path configuration.

### W7: Implement fuzzing mode with corpus management

Add `FUZZ_TEST_CASE("name", Type)` that generates random inputs and tracks inputs that trigger new code paths or assertion failures. Requires a corpus manager for storing interesting inputs, mutation strategies in `generators/`, integration with sanitizers for crash detection, a fuzzing runner in `internal/`, progress reporting, and `--fuzz-duration` / `--fuzz-corpus-dir` CLI options.

### W8: Add hierarchical test organization with fixture inheritance

Implement `TEST_SUITE("suite")` blocks that group test cases with shared fixtures and nested sub-suites. Requires a suite registry parallel to test cases in `internal/`, fixture lifecycle management (setup/teardown per suite), modifications to all reporters for hierarchical output, tag inheritance from parent suites, and `--list-suites` CLI option.

### W9: Implement approval testing workflow

Add `APPROVE(value)` macro that on first run saves the output as approved baseline, and on subsequent runs compares against the approved file. Include `--approve` flag to accept current output, diff display in reporters, binary file support, and custom normalizers. Requires a new approval subsystem, file management, integration with the assertion handler, modifications to console/JSON/JUnit reporters for diff output, and CLI extensions.

### W10: Add cross-compilation test execution support

Implement `--crosscompile-run <command>` that executes tests on a remote target or emulator, collects results via structured output, and presents them locally. Requires splitting the runner into compile-side and execute-side components in `internal/`, a structured result protocol (extending JSON reporter), result deserialization and re-emission through local reporters, timeout handling for remote execution, and CLI integration for target configuration.

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in appveyor.yml

The project configuration file `appveyor.yml` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in appveyor.yml, and update MAINTAINERS.md to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `docs/commercial-users.md`, `docs/ci-and-misc.md`, `appveyor.yml`, `CMakePresets.json`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
