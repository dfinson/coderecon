## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix route parameter parsing not handling URL-encoded slashes in catch-all params

When a route uses a catch-all parameter like `/files/*filepath`, URL-encoded slashes (`%2F`) in the parameter value are decoded before matching, causing nested path segments to split incorrectly. The path parsing in `path.go` decodes percent-encoded characters before parameter extraction.

### N2: Fix `c.Redirect().Route()` not preserving query parameters from the original request

When using `c.Redirect().Route("name")` in `redirect.go`, query parameters from the incoming request are dropped. The redirect target is built from the route pattern only, without forwarding query string values.

### N3: Add `c.Deadline()` method to expose request context deadline to handlers

Handlers have no direct way to check the remaining time budget for a request. Add `c.Deadline()` to the context interface in `ctx_interface.go` and `ctx.go` that returns the deadline from the underlying `context.Context`.

### N4: Fix `Bind().JSON()` not returning proper error for content-type mismatch

When a request has `Content-Type: text/plain` but the handler calls `c.Bind().JSON()`, the binder in `binder/json.go` attempts to parse the body as JSON anyway, producing a confusing parse error instead of a content-type mismatch error.

### N5: Fix CORS middleware not handling `Access-Control-Request-Private-Network` header

The CORS middleware in `middleware/cors/` doesn't handle the `Access-Control-Request-Private-Network` preflight header from the Private Network Access specification. Preflight requests with this header receive no `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network` response.

### N6: Add `OnError` hook for global error handling lifecycle events

The hooks system in `hooks.go` supports `OnRoute`, `OnListen`, and `OnShutdown` but has no hook for error handling events. Add `OnError` that fires whenever `ErrorHandler` processes an error, providing the error, context, and status code to registered callbacks.

### N7: Fix rate limiter middleware not resetting counters on sliding window boundary

The rate limiter in `middleware/limiter/` uses fixed window counters. When a burst of requests arrives at the boundary between two windows, the effective rate can be double the configured limit. The sliding window logic doesn't properly interpolate between windows.

### N8: Fix `c.SendFile()` not setting `Last-Modified` header for embedded filesystem files

When serving files from an `embed.FS` via `c.SendFile()`, the `Last-Modified` header is missing because the embedded filesystem doesn't provide `ModTime()`. The file serving logic in `res.go` should fall back to the application start time.

### N9: Add `MsgPack` response helper to the response interface

The response interface in `res.go` supports `JSON()`, `XML()`, and `CBOR()` but lacks a `MsgPack()` helper for MessagePack serialization, despite having a MsgPack binder in `binder/msgpack.go`. Add `c.MsgPack(data)` for symmetric serialization support.

### N10: Fix session middleware cookie attributes not updated on `session.Save()`

When session configuration changes cookie attributes (e.g., `MaxAge`) between requests, calling `session.Save()` in `middleware/session/` writes the session data but uses the original cookie attributes from session creation rather than current configuration.

## Medium

### M1: Implement request body streaming for large file uploads

Currently `c.Body()` reads the entire request body into memory. Add `c.BodyStream()` that returns an `io.Reader` for streaming processing of large uploads. Changes span `req.go` for the streaming API, `ctx.go` for context lifecycle, `binder/` for stream-aware binding, and `middleware/compress/` for decompression streaming.

### M2: Add route versioning with content negotiation

Implement API versioning via `app.Version("v2", group)` that routes requests based on `Accept-Version` header, URL prefix, or custom header. Changes span `router.go` for version-aware routing, `group.go` for versioned groups, `app.go` for version registration, and `path.go` for version prefix handling.

### M3: Implement typed route parameters with automatic parsing

Add `c.Params().Int("id")`, `c.Params().UUID("token")` with typed extraction and validation error handling. Changes span `ctx.go` for the typed params API, `path.go` for parameter type annotations in route patterns, `router.go` for type-aware matching, and `error.go` for parameter validation errors.

### M4: Add HTTP client retry with circuit breaker pattern

Extend `client/` with circuit breaker support: track failure rates per host, open/half-open/closed states, configurable thresholds, and fallback handlers. Changes span `client/client.go` for circuit breaker integration, `client/hooks.go` for failure tracking hooks, `addon/retry/` for retry coordination, and `client/transport.go` for connection-level tracking.

### M5: Implement request validation middleware with struct tag rules

Add validation middleware that validates bound structs using field tags (`validate:"required,min=1,max=100"`). Changes span `binder/mapping.go` for tag parsing, `bind.go` for validation integration, `error.go` for structured validation errors, and add a `middleware/validator/` package.

### M6: Add response caching with tag-based invalidation

Extend `middleware/cache/` with cache tag support: handlers tag responses with cache keys, and invalidation can purge by tag. Changes span `middleware/cache/` for tag storage and invalidation API, `ctx.go` for cache tag context methods, `middleware/cache/manager.go` for tag-indexed storage, and `app.go` for cache invalidation hooks.

### M7: Implement WebSocket support with room-based broadcasting

Add WebSocket handling with connection grouping, room join/leave, and broadcast capabilities. Changes span `app.go` for WebSocket upgrade configuration, `router.go` for WebSocket route registration, `ctx.go` for upgrade handling, and add a `middleware/websocket/` package with connection management.

### M8: Add structured error responses with problem details (RFC 9457)

Implement RFC 9457 Problem Details error responses: type URI, status, title, detail, and extension fields. Changes span `error.go` for `ProblemDetail` type, `app.go` for problem-details-aware error handler, `ctx.go` for problem response helpers, and `middleware/recover/` for panic-to-problem conversion.

### M9: Implement server-sent events (SSE) support

Add `c.SSEvent()` for sending server-sent events with proper `text/event-stream` content type, event naming, retry configuration, and connection keep-alive. Changes span `res.go` for SSE response methods, `ctx.go` for SSE lifecycle, `app.go` for SSE configuration, and handle fasthttp streaming constraints.

### M10: Add request tracing with OpenTelemetry integration

Implement distributed tracing middleware that creates spans for request handling, propagates trace context, and records attributes. Changes span `middleware/` for a new `otel/` package, `ctx.go` for trace context propagation, `client/hooks.go` for outgoing request span creation, and `router.go` for span naming from route patterns.

## Wide

### W1: Implement gRPC gateway for serving gRPC-Web and REST from the same server

### W3: Implement multi-tenant request isolation

Add tenant-aware request processing: per-tenant middleware stacks, isolated state, tenant-specific rate limits, and tenant resolution from headers/subdomains. Changes span `app.go` for tenant configuration, `router.go` for tenant-scoped routing, `ctx.go` for tenant context, `state.go` for tenant-isolated state, `middleware/limiter/` for per-tenant limits, `middleware/session/` for tenant sessions, and add tenant resolution middleware.

### W4: Add real-time metrics and monitoring dashboard

Implement request metrics collection (latency histograms, error rates, route-level stats) with a built-in dashboard. Changes span `app.go` for metrics collection, `ctx.go` for request timing, `router.go` for route-level metrics, `middleware/logger/` for metric-aware logging, `hooks.go` for metric lifecycle, `middleware/` for a metrics package, and add dashboard UI serving.

### W5: Implement automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificate management

Add automatic TLS certificate provisioning and renewal using ACME. Changes span `listen.go` for ACME integration, `app.go` for certificate configuration, `router.go` for ACME challenge routes, `middleware/redirect/` for HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect, `hooks.go` for certificate lifecycle events, and add certificate storage and renewal modules.

### W6: Add GraphQL endpoint support with schema-first approach

Implement GraphQL request handling: schema parsing, query execution, subscription support via WebSocket, and DataLoader-style batching. Changes span `app.go` for GraphQL endpoint registration, `router.go` for GraphQL route handling, `ctx.go` for GraphQL context, `binder/` for GraphQL variable binding, `res.go` for GraphQL response formatting, `middleware/` for GraphQL-specific middleware, and add GraphQL execution engine.

### W7: Implement service mesh sidecar integration

Add service mesh support: service discovery, load balancing, health checking, retry policies, and circuit breaking for inter-service communication. Changes span `client/client.go` for service discovery, `client/hooks.go` for load balancer selection, `middleware/healthcheck/` for mesh health probes, `app.go` for service registration, `listen.go` for mesh protocol support, `addon/retry/` for mesh retry policies, and add service mesh integration modules.

### W8: Add database-backed session with migration and multi-store support

Implement session storage backends for PostgreSQL, Redis, and SQLite with automatic schema migration, session garbage collection, and store failover. Changes span `middleware/session/` for store interface extension, `middleware/session/store.go` for multi-backend support, `app.go` for session store configuration, `hooks.go` for GC scheduling, `internal/storage/` for backend implementations, and add migration infrastructure.

### W9: Implement request replay and debugging proxy

Add a debugging mode that records request/response pairs, supports replay for debugging, and provides a live request inspector UI. Changes span `ctx.go` for request recording, `app.go` for debug mode configuration, `req.go` for request serialization, `res.go` for response capture, `middleware/logger/` for replay-aware logging, `hooks.go` for recording lifecycle, and add replay storage and inspector UI modules.

### W10: Add comprehensive load testing and benchmarking framework

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in .markdownlint.yml

The project configuration file `.markdownlint.yml` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in .markdownlint.yml, and update binder/README.md to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question.yaml`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yaml`, `.markdownlint.yml`, `.golangci.yml`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
