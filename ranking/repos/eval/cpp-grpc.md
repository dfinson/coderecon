## Tasks

33 tasks (11 narrow, 11 medium, 11 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix `weighted_round_robin` scheduler not updating weights when backend metric reports arrive late

In `load_balancing/weighted_round_robin/static_stride_scheduler.cc`, the `StaticStrideScheduler` builds a pick sequence from endpoint weights at construction time. When out-of-band backend metrics arrive via `oob_backend_metric.cc` and update weights, the scheduler continues using stale weights until the next full rebuild, causing suboptimal load distribution.

### N2: Fix `ServerBuilder::AddListeningPort` not returning error details on bind failure

In `src/cpp/server/server_builder.cc`, when `AddListeningPort` fails to bind (e.g., port already in use), it sets the output port to 0 but the error reason is discarded. The underlying core error from `grpc_server_add_http2_port` contains the OS-level failure message but it is not propagated to the caller.

### N3: Add `grpc.max_connection_idle_ms` channel argument validation

The channel argument `grpc.max_connection_idle_ms` in `src/core/lib/channel/` accepts any integer value including negative numbers, which silently causes the connection to never idle. Add validation in channel argument processing to reject negative values and emit a log warning for zero values. Update `doc/keepalive.md` with validated parameter ranges and default values.

### N4: Fix `ring_hash` policy not rebalancing when endpoint weights change

In `load_balancing/ring_hash/ring_hash.cc`, the ring is constructed from endpoint addresses with a fixed number of virtual nodes. When endpoint weights are updated via service config, the ring is not rebuilt because the address list hasn't changed, causing traffic distribution to remain based on stale weights.

### N5: Fix `CompletionQueue::AsyncNext` not respecting `gpr_timespec` deadline on Windows

In `src/core/lib/surface/completion_queue.cc`, the `AsyncNext` deadline conversion on Windows uses `gpr_time_to_millis` which truncates sub-millisecond precision. For very short deadlines (microsecond-level), this truncates to zero, causing `AsyncNext` to return immediately instead of waiting.

### N6: Add `ClientContext::GetServerInitialMetadata` method for callback API

The callback-based client API in `include/grpcpp/support/client_callback.h` does not provide access to server initial metadata before the response is received. Add `GetServerInitialMetadata()` to `ClientContext` that returns metadata received in the HTTP/2 HEADERS frame, available after `OnReadInitialMetadataDone`.

### N7: Fix DNS resolver not honoring `grpc.dns_min_time_between_resolutions_ms` for SRV records

In `resolver/dns/c_ares/dns_resolver_ares.cc`, the minimum resolution interval is enforced for A/AAAA queries but SRV record re-resolution bypasses the timer check because SRV and address resolutions are tracked with separate timestamps.

### N8: Fix `fake_resolver` not notifying watchers on empty address list update

In `resolver/fake/fake_resolver.cc`, when the fake resolver is updated with an empty address list (simulating all backends going down), the `ResolverResultHandler` is not invoked because the empty result is treated as "no change" rather than a meaningful update.

### N9: Add compression algorithm name to channelz socket trace events

In `src/core/channelz/`, socket trace events record message send/receive but do not include which compression algorithm (gzip, deflate, none) was used for each message. Add the algorithm name to the trace event data in the channelz socket node.

### N10: Fix `pick_first` policy not shuffling addresses when `grpc.service_config_disable_resolution` is set

In `load_balancing/pick_first/pick_first.cc`, the random address shuffling for happy eyeballs is skipped when the service config is provided directly via channel arguments instead of through name resolution, because the shuffling is gated on a resolution-originated flag.

### N11: Fix `doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md` not documenting RST_STREAM error code mapping

The `doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md` specification document describes HTTP/2 frame mapping for gRPC but does not document how HTTP/2 RST_STREAM error codes map to gRPC status codes. Add a mapping table for all RST_STREAM error codes to `doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md`, cross-reference `doc/statuscodes.md` and `doc/http-grpc-status-mapping.md`, and update `doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md` with the equivalent mapping for gRPC-Web.

## Medium

### M1: Implement per-call memory tracking and limits

Add per-call memory accounting that tracks allocations for messages, metadata, and serialization buffers. Enforce a configurable per-call memory limit (`grpc.max_call_memory_bytes`) that returns `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` when exceeded. Requires changes in `src/core/call/`, `src/core/lib/resource_quota/resource_quota.h`, and the call filter chain to integrate with the existing resource quota system.

### M2: Add client-side request hedging support for unary RPCs

Implement hedging as specified in the gRPC retry design: send multiple copies of a unary RPC simultaneously and use the first successful response. Requires modifying `src/core/client_channel/` for hedging policy parsing from service config, `src/core/call/` for managing parallel call attempts, and `src/cpp/client/` for exposing hedging configuration in `ChannelArguments`.

### M3: Implement graceful server drain with configurable deadline

Add `Server::DrainConnections(deadline)` that sends GOAWAY to all connected clients, waits for in-flight RPCs to complete up to the deadline, then force-closes remaining connections. Requires changes in `src/cpp/server/server_cc.cc`, `src/core/server/`, and the HTTP/2 transport layer in `src/core/ext/transport/` for GOAWAY frame handling.

### M4: Add server-side interceptor support for metadata modification

The server interceptor API in `include/grpcpp/support/server_interceptor.h` allows observing calls but does not support modifying response metadata after handlers execute. Add `ModifyTrailingMetadata` hook that allows interceptors to add or modify trailing metadata before it is sent. Requires changes to the server interceptor interface, method handler implementation in `src/cpp/server/`, and the call filter chain.

### M5: Implement load balancing policy hot-swap without connection disruption

Add support for changing the active load balancing policy at runtime (e.g., from `round_robin` to `weighted_round_robin`) without dropping existing connections. Requires modifying `load_balancing/child_policy_handler.cc`, the subchannel pool in `src/core/client_channel/`, and ensuring in-flight RPCs on existing subchannels complete before the old policy is destroyed.

### M6: Add structured logging with trace context propagation

Implement structured JSON logging for gRPC internals that includes trace IDs and span IDs propagated from incoming `grpc-trace-bin` headers. Requires modifications to `src/core/telemetry/`, the logging infrastructure in `src/core/lib/debug/`, call metadata extraction in `src/core/call/`, and adding a structured log output mode to the C++ server and client wrappers. Update `doc/environment_variables.md` with structured logging configuration options.

### M7: Implement adaptive compression based on message characteristics

Add a `grpc.adaptive_compression` channel argument that selects compression algorithm per-message based on message size and content entropy. Small messages skip compression, large compressible messages use gzip, and already-compressed payloads use identity. Requires changes in `src/core/lib/compression/compression_internal.h`, the message compression filter, and per-call compression tracking.

### M8: Add connection pool management API for C++ client

Implement `ChannelPool` that manages multiple `grpc::Channel` instances to the same target with configurable pool size, connection affinity by call metadata, and automatic pool resizing based on load. Requires new files in `src/cpp/client/`, integration with `create_channel.cc`, and load metrics from the subchannel layer.

### M9: Implement health check aggregation across subchannel groups

Add aggregated health status reporting that combines health check results from all subchannels in a client channel into a single health state. Requires extending `src/cpp/server/health/`, modifying `load_balancing/health_check_client.cc`, and adding a health aggregation policy configurable per service name in the service config.

### M10: Add server-side rate limiting filter

Implement a `RateLimitingFilter` that limits the number of concurrent RPCs per service/method and per-client identity. Return `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` with retry-after metadata when limits are exceeded. Requires a new filter in `src/core/filter/`, token bucket implementation, integration with the server filter chain, and configuration via server builder options.

### M11: Improve CMake build configuration and dependency management

Overhaul `CMakeLists.txt` with modern CMake 3.20+ practices: add `FetchContent` integration for third-party dependencies as an alternative to `third_party/` submodules; update `cmake/` support modules with better find-package support for system-installed dependencies; add `requirements.txt` pinning with hash verification for Python build dependencies; configure `build_handwritten.yaml` and `build_autogenerated.yaml` with clearer documentation; and update `BUILDING.md` with step-by-step instructions for all supported platforms. Changes span `CMakeLists.txt`, `cmake/`, `requirements.txt`, `build_handwritten.yaml`, `BUILDING.md`, and `MODULE.bazel`.

## Wide

### W1: Implement client-side load reporting and feedback loop

Add client-side load reporting that collects RPC latency, error rates, and backend utilization from response trailers, aggregates them locally, and feeds them back into load balancing decisions. Requires changes to `src/core/load_balancing/` (policy interface and weighted_round_robin), `src/core/client_channel/` (metric collection), `src/cpp/client/` (stats exposure), and `src/core/telemetry/` (metric aggregation with configurable windows).

### W2: Add end-to-end request tracing with W3C Trace Context propagation

Implement W3C Trace Context header (`traceparent`, `tracestate`) propagation through the entire gRPC call stack. Auto-generate trace and span IDs for untraced requests, propagate context through subchannel selection, load balancer picks, and server-side handling. Changes span `src/core/call/`, `src/core/filter/`, `src/core/client_channel/`, `src/cpp/server/`, `include/grpcpp/`, and `src/core/telemetry/`.

### W3: Implement multi-target client channel with failover

Add `MultiChannel` that connects to multiple target URIs simultaneously and fails over to the next target when the primary becomes unhealthy. Support priority-based failover, health-check-driven promotion, and automatic fail-back. Requires a new channel implementation in `src/cpp/client/`, a failover load balancing policy in `src/core/load_balancing/`, resolver integration in `src/core/resolver/`, and modifications to `include/grpcpp/` for the public API.

### W4: Add server reflection v2 with streaming schema updates

Extend the proto server reflection beyond the current `ServerReflection` service to support streaming schema change notifications when services are dynamically registered/unregistered. Requires modifications to `src/cpp/server/` (dynamic service registration), `src/cpp/ext/proto_server_reflection_plugin.cc`, a new streaming reflection service definition, integration with the server's service registry, and channelz for tracking service changes.

### W5: Implement connection migration for mobile clients

Add connection migration support that transparently reconnects RPCs to a new server when the client's network changes (WiFi → cellular). Preserve in-flight unary RPCs by retrying with the original deadline and metadata. Requires changes to `src/core/lib/event_engine/` (network change detection), `src/core/transport/` (connection state machine), `src/core/client_channel/` (subchannel migration), and `src/cpp/client/` (migration policy configuration).

### W6: Add comprehensive server admin and diagnostics API

Implement a gRPC admin service that provides runtime diagnostics: connection list with state and metadata, per-method RPC counters with latency histograms, active call inspection, and dynamic log level adjustment. Requires a new admin service in `src/cpp/server/admin/`, integration with channelz in `src/core/channelz/`, telemetry counters in `src/core/telemetry/`, the server core in `src/core/server/`, and public API in `include/grpcpp/ext/`.

### W7: Implement custom transport plugin API

Add a transport plugin interface that allows registering custom transport implementations (e.g., QUIC, Unix domain socket with SCM_RIGHTS). Define a stable transport API abstracting over `src/core/ext/transport/`, add a transport registry, modify the server and client channel to select transports dynamically, and update `ServerBuilder` and `ChannelArguments` for transport configuration. Changes span `src/core/transport/`, `src/core/ext/transport/`, `src/core/client_channel/`, `src/core/server/`, and `include/grpcpp/`.

### W8: Add deadline propagation and budget management across service meshes

Implement automatic deadline propagation from incoming RPCs to outgoing RPCs, with configurable deadline budget allocation per downstream call. Track deadline budget consumption and expose it via channelz. Requires modifications to `src/core/call/` (deadline context), `src/core/client_channel/` (budget allocation), `src/core/filter/` (deadline filter), `src/cpp/server/` (incoming deadline extraction), `src/core/channelz/` (budget metrics), and `include/grpcpp/` for configuration API.

### W9: Implement service mesh sidecar mode with traffic management

Add a sidecar proxy mode where a gRPC server acts as a transparent proxy with traffic management: request routing by header, traffic splitting by percentage, fault injection, and circuit breaking. Requires a proxy transport in `src/core/ext/transport/`, routing configuration via xDS in `src/core/xds/`, a circuit breaker in `src/core/load_balancing/`, fault injection filter in `src/core/filter/`, and CLI/config integration in `src/cpp/server/`.

### W10: Add comprehensive RPC replay and record infrastructure

Implement `--grpc-record <path>` and `--grpc-replay <path>` modes that capture and replay RPC traffic including metadata, messages, timing, and errors. Support request/response matching for test scenario creation. Requires a recording filter in `src/core/filter/`, a file format and serializer, a replay server in `src/cpp/server/`, a replay client in `src/cpp/client/`, timing simulation, and integration with the test utilities in `include/grpcpp/test/`.

### W11: Overhaul developer documentation and architecture guides

Comprehensively restructure the project's extensive documentation: update `doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md` and `doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md` with latest protocol version clarifications; consolidate `doc/load-balancing.md`, `doc/naming.md`, `doc/service_config.md`, and `doc/connectivity-semantics-and-api.md` into a coherent client architecture guide; rewrite `BUILDING.md` with platform-specific build instructions for Linux, macOS, Windows, and cross-compilation; update `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CONTRIBUTING_STEPS.md` with development workflow and CI pipeline explanation; refresh `CONCEPTS.md` with current architecture diagrams; update `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with common debugging scenarios; add `GOVERNANCE.md` decision-making process documentation; verify `MAINTAINERS.md` and `MANIFEST.md` accuracy; and update `SECURITY.md` vulnerability reporting process. Changes span `doc/` (PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md, load-balancing.md, service_config.md, keepalive.md, environment_variables.md, statuscodes.md, compression.md, versioning.md), `BUILDING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING_STEPS.md`, `CONCEPTS.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `MANIFEST.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `README.md`, and `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`.
