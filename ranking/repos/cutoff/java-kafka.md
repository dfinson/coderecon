## Why this repo

- **Industry-defining system**: Apache Kafka is the de facto standard
  for distributed event streaming, with a rich multi-module codebase
  covering client libraries (producer, consumer, admin), Kafka Streams
  DSL, Kafka Connect framework, KRaft consensus, group coordination,
  and server internals. The architecture spans distributed protocols,
  storage engines, serialization, and configuration management.
- **Rich history**: 28K+ stars, extensive contributor base. Covers
  distributed systems edge cases, protocol versioning, and backward
  compatibility across major releases.
- **Permissive**: Apache-2.0 license.
- **Scale anchor**: Large codebase (6000+ Java source files across
  30+ modules) anchoring the "Large" end of scale assessment.

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Add ProducerRecord.Builder for fluent construction

`ProducerRecord` in `clients/producer/ProducerRecord.java` uses a
constructor with up to 6 parameters (topic, partition, timestamp, key,
value, headers), making construction error-prone. Add a static
`ProducerRecord.builder(topic, value)` that returns a `Builder` with
`.partition()`, `.key()`, `.timestamp()`, and `.headers()` methods,
validating that `topic` is non-null.

### N2: Fix MockProducer not tracking partitioner calls

`MockProducer` in `clients/producer/MockProducer.java` records sent
records but does not invoke or track the configured `Partitioner`.
When testing partition-aware logic, the mock always uses partition 0
or the explicitly specified partition. Add partitioner invocation in
`send()` when no partition is explicitly set, and expose
`partitionerCallCount()` for test assertions.

### N3: Add ConsumerRecord.hasKey() and hasValue() convenience methods

`ConsumerRecord` in `clients/consumer/ConsumerRecord.java` stores
`key` and `value` as nullable fields, but there are no convenience
methods to check for null without retrieving the value. Add
`hasKey()` and `hasValue()` methods returning `boolean` that check
for non-null key and value respectively, reducing null-check
boilerplate in consumer loops.

### N4: Fix ConfigDef not validating dependent config references

The `ConfigDef` framework in `common/config/ConfigDef.java` allows
declaring config dependencies via `dependents()`, but does not validate
that referenced config keys actually exist in the same `ConfigDef`.
A typo in a dependent reference silently produces a broken config
definition. Add validation in `ConfigDef.validate()` that all
`dependents` keys exist in the config definition.

### N5: Add Header.toString() with value decoding

The `Header` interface in `common/header/Header.java` stores values as
`byte[]`, but the default `RecordHeader.toString()` prints the raw
byte array reference. Override `toString()` in `RecordHeader` to
decode the value as UTF-8 (with fallback to hex representation for
non-UTF-8 bytes) for readable log output.

### N6: Fix RoundRobinPartitioner not handling topic additions

The `RoundRobinPartitioner` in `clients/producer/RoundRobinPartitioner.java`
uses a `ConcurrentMap<String, AtomicInteger>` to track per-topic
counters, but when a new topic is added at runtime (via metadata
update), the first partition assignment always starts at 0. Initialize
new topic counters with `ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt()` to
distribute initial load evenly across partitions.

### N7: Add Serde.forClass() factory for common types

The `Serdes` utility class in `common/serialization/Serdes.java`
requires explicit method calls (`Serdes.String()`, `Serdes.Integer()`)
for each type. Add a `Serdes.forClass(Class<T>)` method that returns
the appropriate `Serde<T>` for common types (`String`, `Integer`,
`Long`, `Double`, `byte[]`, `ByteBuffer`, `UUID`) by lookup, throwing
`IllegalArgumentException` for unsupported types.

### N8: Fix KafkaFuture.thenApply not preserving exception context

`KafkaFuture.thenApply()` in `common/KafkaFuture.java` wraps
the mapping function but does not preserve the original exception's
stack trace when the function itself throws. The resulting
`ExecutionException` loses the cause chain. Wrap function exceptions
in a new exception that preserves both the mapping failure and any
original cause.

### N9: Add StreamsConfig.validate() for topology-aware config checking

`StreamsConfig` in `streams/StreamsConfig.java` validates individual
config values but does not cross-check against the topology (e.g.,
`num.standby.replicas` > 0 requires state stores, `processing.guarantee`
= `exactly_once_v2` requires specific broker versions). Add a
`validate(Topology)` method that checks config values against topology
requirements and returns a list of warnings.

### N10: Fix JoinWindows.of() not rejecting negative durations

`JoinWindows.of()` in `streams/kstream/JoinWindows.java` accepts a
`Duration` parameter but does not validate that it is non-negative. A
negative duration produces a join window where `afterMs < beforeMs`,
which silently produces no join results. Add an
`IllegalArgumentException` for negative or zero durations.

## Medium

### M1: Implement dead-letter queue support for consumer deserialization failures

When `KafkaConsumer.poll()` encounters a deserialization error, it
throws `SerializationException`, which halts processing. Implement a
configurable `DeserializationExceptionHandler` that routes failed
records to a dead-letter topic with headers containing the original
topic, partition, offset, and exception message. Requires changes to
the consumer fetcher, a new handler interface in `common/serialization/`,
and configuration in `ConsumerConfig`.

### M2: Add record header propagation to Kafka Streams

Records flowing through Kafka Streams DSL operations (`map`,
`filter`, `groupByKey`) do not automatically propagate headers from
input to output records. Implement configurable header propagation
policies: `ALL` (forward all), `NONE`, and `SELECTED` (by key
pattern). Requires changes to the streams processor context, the
record forwarding pipeline in `processor/`, and configuration in
`StreamsConfig`.

### M3: Implement Admin client retry with exponential backoff

The Admin client methods (`createTopics`, `deleteTopics`,
`describeConfigs`) use a fixed retry with linear backoff that is
configured globally. Add per-operation retry configuration with
exponential backoff and jitter, configurable max attempts, and
retryable exception classification. Touches `AdminClientConfig`,
the `KafkaAdminClient` call construction, and the `KafkaFuture`
timeout mechanism.

### M4: Add schema evolution support to JSON converter

The JSON converter in `connect/json/` serializes Connect schemas
but does not handle schema evolution (adding fields, removing fields,
changing types). Implement forward/backward/full compatibility
checking for JSON schemas, with configurable compatibility mode and
clear error messages for incompatible schema changes. Touches the
JSON converter, `connect/data/Schema.java`, and a new compatibility
checker module.

### M5: Implement configurable record timestamp policies for Streams

Kafka Streams uses `TimestampExtractor` to assign timestamps but
does not support per-operation timestamp policies (e.g., use event
time for joins but wall-clock time for windowed aggregations). Add
a `Consumed.withTimestampPolicy(TimestampPolicy)` method that
configures per-source-node timestamp extraction with fallback to the
global extractor. Touches `StreamsBuilder`, `Consumed`, and the
processor topology builder.

### M6: Add Connect task progress reporting

Connect tasks run indefinitely but provide no structured progress
reporting beyond metrics. Implement a `TaskProgressReporter` interface
that tasks can use to report: records processed, bytes transferred,
current position (e.g., file offset, database cursor), and
estimated completion for bounded tasks. Expose progress via the
Connect REST API. Touches `connect/api/`, `connect/runtime/`, and
the REST endpoints.

### M7: Implement topic-level producer batching configuration

`KafkaProducer` uses global `batch.size` and `linger.ms` settings,
but different topics may have different latency/throughput
requirements. Add `ProducerConfig.withTopicOverrides(topic, overrides)`
that allows per-topic batch size and linger configuration. Requires
changes to the record accumulator's batching logic, `ProducerConfig`,
and the sender thread's drain logic.

### M8: Add KStream.peek() with error handling

`KStream.peek()` in `streams/kstream/KStream.java` accepts a
`ForeachAction` that can throw unchecked exceptions, which kills
the stream thread. Add a `peekOrHandle(action, errorHandler)` variant
that catches exceptions from the action, routes them to the error
handler with the record context, and continues processing. Requires
changes to `KStream`, the `ForeachProcessor`, and the processor
node builder.

### M9: Implement config encryption for sensitive values

Configuration values like passwords and API keys are stored in
plaintext in `server.properties` and Connect worker configs. Add a
`ConfigProvider` that encrypts sensitive config values at rest using
a master key, with support for AES-256-GCM encryption, key rotation,
and integration with the existing `ConfigProvider` SPI. Touches
`common/config/`, the config provider framework, and documentation.

### M10: Add Streams topology optimization hints

The Streams DSL builder performs topology optimization (merge
repartition topics, reuse state stores) but provides no visibility
into what optimizations were applied or missed. Add
`StreamsBuilder.describeOptimizations()` that returns a report of
applied and available optimizations, with suggestions for improving
the topology structure. Touches `StreamsBuilder`, the topology
optimizer, and a new `OptimizationReport` class.

## Wide

### W1: Implement exactly-once semantics for Connect source connectors

Kafka Connect source connectors currently provide at-least-once
delivery. Implement exactly-once semantics by coordinating source
offset commits with producer transactions. Requires changes to the
Connect worker's offset management, the source task execution loop,
transaction fence management for zombie tasks, the herder for
task assignment, and the REST API for EOS configuration. Changes span
`connect/runtime/`, `connect/api/`, coordinator communication, and
the producer integration layer.

### W2: Add multi-cluster topic mirroring with conflict resolution

Implement a built-in cross-cluster replication framework (beyond
MirrorMaker 2) that supports bidirectional replication with
conflict resolution policies (last-writer-wins, merge,
application-defined). Requires changes to the replication protocol,
a new conflict resolution interface, cluster metadata exchange,
offset translation, consumer group mirroring, and ACL
synchronization. Changes span a new `mirror/` module, `clients/`,
`server/`, and configuration.

### W3: Implement a SQL query layer over Kafka topics

Add a SQL interface (`SELECT * FROM topic WHERE key = 'x' AND
timestamp > '2024-01-01'`) that compiles SQL queries into Kafka
Streams topologies, executes them against live topics or materialized
views, and returns results via a JDBC-compatible interface. Requires
a SQL parser, query planner, Streams-based executor, result
materialization, JDBC driver, and a query server. Changes span new
`sql/` modules, `streams/`, `clients/`, and REST API endpoints.

### W4: Add end-to-end encryption for record payloads

Implement transparent record-level encryption where producers encrypt
payloads with per-topic keys and consumers decrypt transparently. Key
management should integrate with external KMS (AWS KMS, HashiCorp
Vault) via a `KeyProvider` SPI. Requires changes to the producer
interceptor chain, consumer interceptor chain, a new `crypto/` module,
key rotation support, header-based key metadata, and serialization
integration. Changes span `clients/producer/`, `clients/consumer/`,
`common/`, and a new `security/crypto/` package.

### W5: Implement a Kafka Streams testing framework with time control

Extend `TopologyTestDriver` with: deterministic time advancement
(tick-by-tick), multi-partition simulation, state store snapshots and
assertions, record-by-record processing with checkpoint/restore,
and integration test mode with embedded broker. Include assertion
DSL for output verification. Changes span `streams/test-utils/`,
`TopologyTestDriver`, a new assertion module, embedded broker
integration, and documentation.

### W6: Add observability integration across all components

Implement unified observability covering: OpenTelemetry trace
propagation through produce-consume chains (trace context in headers),
structured logging with correlation IDs, metric export to
Prometheus/OTLP, and health check endpoints for all components.
Requires changes to the producer, consumer, streams processor, Connect
runtime, and server. Changes span `common/metrics/`, `clients/`,
`streams/`, `connect/runtime/`, `server/`, and new OpenTelemetry
integration modules.

### W7: Implement tiered storage for topic partitions

Add a tiered storage layer that moves older log segments from local
disk to remote storage (S3, GCS, HDFS) while maintaining transparent
read access. Requires a `RemoteLogManager` with pluggable storage
backends, segment upload/download coordination, remote log index
maintenance, fetch integration for remote reads, retention policy
enforcement on remote storage, and broker leader/follower
coordination. Changes span `storage/`, `server/`, `server-common/`,
log management, and configuration.

### W8: Add schema registry integration to the client libraries

Implement built-in schema registry support in the producer and
consumer serializers: automatic schema registration on produce,
schema compatibility checking, schema caching, and deserialization
with schema evolution (Avro, Protobuf, JSON Schema). Requires a
schema registry client, schema-aware serializers/deserializers, cache
management, compatibility mode configuration, and Connect integration.
Changes span `common/serialization/`, `clients/`, `connect/json/`,
a new `schema-registry-client/` module, and configuration.

### W9: Implement consumer group protocol v2 with server-side assignment

Redesign the consumer group protocol to move partition assignment to
the server side (group coordinator), eliminating the need for client-
side assignor implementations. Requires changes to the group
coordinator's assignment algorithm, the consumer heartbeat protocol,
the JoinGroup/SyncGroup request handling, client-side simplification,
backward-compatible protocol negotiation, and Streams integration.
Changes span `group-coordinator/`, `clients/consumer/`, `server/`,
protocol definitions, and `streams/`.

### W10: Add multi-tenancy with resource quotas and namespace isolation

Implement multi-tenancy primitives: topic namespaces with isolation
guarantees, per-tenant resource quotas (throughput, storage, connection
count), tenant-aware ACLs, quota enforcement in the request handler,
tenant-scoped metrics, and an admin API for tenant management.
Requires changes to topic naming, the quota manager, ACL evaluator,
request processing pipeline, metrics collection, and the admin client.
Changes span `server/`, `server-common/`, `clients/admin/`, `common/`,
and configuration.

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in streams/quickstart/pom.xml

The project configuration file `streams/quickstart/pom.xml` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in streams/quickstart/pom.xml, and update release/README.md to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `.github/workflows/pr-update.yml`, `.github/workflows/pr-labels-cron.yml`, `streams/quickstart/pom.xml`, `tests/setup.cfg`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
