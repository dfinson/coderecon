## Why this repo

- **Canonical PHP testing framework**: PHPUnit is the de-facto standard
  for unit and integration testing in PHP, used across virtually every
  major PHP project. Tasks require understanding a mature, deeply
  interconnected architecture covering assertion logic, test execution
  lifecycle, CLI configuration, and extension hooks.
- **Well-structured**: Source under `src/` with clear module boundaries —
  `Framework/` (TestCase, assertions, constraints, mocking),
  `Runner/` (test execution and suite orchestration),
  `TextUI/` (CLI and configuration), `Event/` (extension event system),
  `Metadata/` (attribute and annotation handling), and
  `Logging/` (result formatters).
- **Rich constraint system**: The `Constraint/` directory contains ~40
  individual constraint classes implementing a composable assertion
  architecture, providing fine-grained matching patterns.
- **Rich history**: 20K+ stars, the foundation of PHP testing
  infrastructure. Issues span assertion correctness, test lifecycle
  edge cases, metadata parsing, and output formatting.
- **Permissive**: BSD-3-Clause license.

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix IsEqualWithDelta constraint not propagating delta to nested object comparisons

`IsEqualWithDelta` accepts a `$delta` parameter for float comparison
tolerance, but when comparing objects or arrays containing nested
float values, the delta is not propagated through the internal
comparator. Objects like `new Coord(1.0, [2.001])` vs
`new Coord(1.0, [2.002])` fail with delta `0.01` even though all
floats are within tolerance. Fix `IsEqualWithDelta.php` to ensure the
delta is passed through to the recursive comparison in the
`evaluate()` method.

### N2: Fix TestCase::expectException not clearing between data provider iterations

When a test method uses both `expectException()` and a data provider,
the expected exception set in one iteration carries over to the next
if the subsequent iteration does not call `expectException()` again.
Fix `TestCase.php` to reset the expected exception state between data
provider iterations in the lifecycle reset logic.

### N3: Fix AttributeParser not handling #[Depends] with class-qualified method names

`AttributeParser` parses `#[Depends]` attributes but fails when the
dependency specifies a full class-qualified method name (e.g.,
`#[Depends('OtherTest::testSetup')]`). The parser attempts to split on
`::` but does not handle namespace backslashes in the class portion,
causing the dependency to be silently dropped. Fix
`AttributeParser.php` to correctly parse fully qualified class names
with namespace separators in `#[Depends]` attribute values.

### N4: Fix Count constraint failing on generators that have already started

The `Count` constraint calls `iterator_count()` on generators, but if
the generator has already yielded values, the count only reflects
remaining elements, not the total. Fix `Count.php` to detect partially
consumed generators and report an informative failure message instead
of an incorrect count.

### N5: Fix MockBuilder::onlyMethods silently ignoring non-existent method names

`MockBuilder::onlyMethods()` accepts an array of method names to mock
but does not validate that the methods exist on the mocked class. If a
method name is misspelled, the mock silently ignores it, leading to
confusing test behavior. Fix `MockBuilder.php` to throw an
`InvalidArgumentException` when a method name does not exist on the
target class.

### N6: Fix ProgressPrinter not accounting for multi-byte characters in alignment

`ProgressPrinter` right-aligns the progress counter (e.g.,
`... 3 / 15`) based on string length. When test names or group labels
contain multi-byte UTF-8 characters, the alignment calculation is
wrong because `strlen` counts bytes, not display columns. Fix
`ProgressPrinter.php` to use `mb_strwidth()` for alignment.

### N7: Fix Filter stack trace exclusion not matching namespaced class paths

`Filter.php` excludes internal PHPUnit frames from failure stack
traces using prefix matching against file paths. When PHPUnit is
installed via a symlinked Composer path repository, the real path
does not match the exclusion prefix. Fix `Filter.php` to resolve
symlinks with `realpath()` before applying the exclusion list.

### N8: Fix Configuration Loader not validating duplicate testSuite names in XML

`Configuration/Loader.php` parses `<testsuite>` elements from
`phpunit.xml` but accepts duplicate `name` attributes without error.
When two suites share a name, the `--testsuite` CLI filter matches
only the first one, silently dropping tests. Fix the loader to detect
and report duplicate test suite names during configuration parsing.
Also update `phpunit.xsd` to add an XSD `unique` constraint on the
`name` attribute of `<testsuite>` elements so that XML-level
validation catches duplicates before the loader runs.

### N9: Fix JUnitXmlLogger emitting invalid XML for assertion messages with CDATA

`JUnitXmlLogger` wraps failure messages in CDATA sections, but if the
assertion message itself contains `]]>`, the resulting XML is
malformed. Fix `JUnitXmlLogger.php` to escape or split CDATA sections
when the message contains the CDATA end delimiter.

### N10: Fix Event Dispatcher not catching subscriber exceptions during Test::Prepared

When `Dispatcher.php` fires `Test\Prepared` events, an exception
thrown by one subscriber aborts dispatch to subsequent subscribers and
propagates into the runner, causing the test to be marked as errored
rather than simply logging the subscriber failure. Fix the dispatcher
to catch subscriber exceptions during `Prepared` events and report
them via a warning instead.

### N11: Fix `phpunit.xsd` schema not validating the `displayDetailsOnPhpunitDeprecations` attribute

The `phpunit.xsd` XML Schema file defines the `phpUnitType` complex
type with attributes for `beStrictAboutOutputDuringTests`,
`failOnRisky`, `failOnWarning`, and other settings, but does not
include the `displayDetailsOnPhpunitDeprecations` attribute that was
added in PHPUnit 13.1 and is used in the project's own `phpunit.xml`.
This causes XML validators to report the attribute as invalid. Add
the missing `xs:attribute` definition to `phpunit.xsd` with
`type="xs:boolean"` and `default="false"`. Also update
`schema/13.0.xsd` to add the attribute for consistency, and update
`DEPRECATIONS.md` to reference the schema version where the attribute
was introduced.

## Medium

### M1: Add configurable assertion failure diff output format

Implement a `--diff-format` CLI option supporting `unified` (default),
`side-by-side`, and `json` output modes for assertion failure diffs.
Changes span `TextUI/Command/Command.php` for argument parsing,
`TextUI/Configuration/Configuration.php` for the setting,
`TextUI/Configuration/Merger.php` for CLI-to-config mapping, and
`Framework/Assert.php` plus `Constraint/IsEqual.php` for invoking the
selected formatter. Also update `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to add a
CI matrix entry that runs the test suite with `--diff-format=json` to
ensure the new output mode does not regress.

### M2: Implement retry-on-failure support for flaky tests

Add a `#[Retry(times: 3)]` attribute that causes a failing test to be
re-executed up to the specified number of times before being marked as
failed. Changes span `Metadata/Parser/AttributeParser.php` for
parsing the new attribute, `Metadata/Metadata.php` for the retry
metadata type, `Runner/TestRunner.php` for the retry loop, and
`Event/Events/Test/` for new `Retried` event emission.

### M3: Add parallel data provider execution within a test method

Implement `#[ParallelDataProvider]` that runs data provider iterations
concurrently using PHP fibers or child processes. Results are collected
and reported once all iterations complete. Changes span
`Framework/DataProvider/DataProvider.php` for parallel scheduling,
`Framework/TestCase.php` for fiber-based iteration,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for result aggregation, and
`Event/Events/Test/` for per-iteration event granularity.

### M4: Implement constraint composition DSL with named matchers

Add `Assert::that($value)->is()->greaterThan(5)->and()->lessThan(10)`
fluent assertion syntax that composes constraints via a builder.
Changes span `Framework/Assert.php` for the `that()` entry point,
new `Framework/Constraint/Builder/` classes for the fluent chain,
`Framework/Constraint/LogicalAnd.php` and `LogicalOr.php` for
integration, and `Framework/Constraint/Constraint.php` for builder
protocol support.

### M5: Add mock method call recording with assertion replay

Implement `MockBuilder::enableCallRecording()` that records all method
calls on a mock and provides `assertCallSequence()` to verify specific
orderings. Changes span `MockObject/MockBuilder.php` for the
configuration, `MockObject/MockObject.php` for the recording
interface, new `MockObject/CallRecorder.php` for storage, and
`MockObject/Rule/InvocationOrder.php` for sequence validation
integration.

### M6: Implement test impact analysis using metadata dependencies

Add `--affected-since=<commit>` that uses `@covers` and `@depends`
metadata to determine which tests are affected by changed classes.
Changes span `TextUI/Command/Command.php` for the CLI option,
`Metadata/Registry.php` for coverage-to-test mapping,
`Runner/TestSuiteLoader.php` for filtering the suite based on
affected classes, and `TextUI/Configuration/TestSuiteMapper.php` for
integration with suite construction.

### M7: Add structured test result output in JSON format

Implement `--result-format=json` that emits a JSON document with test
results, durations, assertion counts, and failure details. Changes
span `TextUI/Command/Command.php` for the option,
`TextUI/Output/Json/JsonResultPrinter.php` as a new printer
implementation, `Runner/TestRunner.php` for wiring the printer, and
`Event/Subscriber/Subscriber.php` for a JSON-emitting subscriber.

### M8: Implement mock generation caching for faster test startup

Add a disk cache for generated mock class code, keyed by the mocked
class signature hash. On subsequent runs, load cached mock classes
instead of regenerating them. Changes span
`MockObject/Generator/Generator.php` for cache lookup and storage,
`MockObject/MockBuilder.php` for cache path configuration,
`TextUI/Configuration/Configuration.php` for the cache directory
setting, and `Util/` for cache invalidation utilities.

### M9: Add custom constraint registration via configuration

Implement `<constraint>` elements in `phpunit.xml` that register
custom constraint classes for use in assertions without requiring
explicit imports. Changes span `TextUI/Configuration/Loader.php` for
parsing constraint registrations, `TextUI/Configuration/Configuration.php`
for storing them, `Framework/Assert.php` for looking up registered
constraints by alias, and `Framework/Constraint/Constraint.php` for
the registration protocol.

### M10: Implement snapshot testing support for assertions

Add `Assert::assertMatchesSnapshot($value)` that compares a value
against a stored snapshot file, creating it on first run. Support
JSON, serialized PHP, and text snapshot formats. Changes span
`Framework/Assert.php` for the assertion method, new
`Framework/Snapshot/` classes for storage and comparison,
`Framework/Constraint/MatchesSnapshot.php` for the constraint
implementation, and `TextUI/Command/Command.php` for
`--update-snapshots` flag support.

### M11: Update build configuration and CI for PHAR reproducibility

The `build.xml` Ant configuration provides targets for dependency
installation and PHAR building but does not produce reproducible
PHAR archives (timestamps and file ordering vary between builds).
Add a `reproducible-phar` target to `build.xml` that normalises
file timestamps and sorts entries deterministically. Update
`composer.json` to add a `scripts.build` command that invokes the
Ant target for environments without Ant installed. Update
`.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to add a `phar-build` job that builds
the PHAR and verifies its checksum matches across two independent
builds. Update `phpstan.neon` to add the `build/` directory
to `excludePaths` so the PHAR-scoped source files are not
analysed alongside the main source.

## Wide

### W1: Implement attribute-based test lifecycle hooks with priority ordering

Add `#[BeforeAll]`, `#[AfterAll]`, `#[BeforeEach]`, `#[AfterEach]`
attributes with `priority` parameter that replace the inheritance-based
`setUp`/`tearDown` lifecycle. Support multiple hook methods per class
with ordered execution and cross-class hook inheritance. Changes span
`Metadata/Parser/AttributeParser.php` for new attributes,
`Metadata/Metadata.php` for hook metadata types,
`Framework/TestCase.php` for lifecycle invocation rewrite,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for suite-level hook execution,
`Event/Events/Test/` for hook-specific events, and
`TextUI/Output/` for hook failure reporting.

### W2: Add test isolation via process forking with shared fixture support

Implement `#[RunInSeparateProcess]` improvements that fork test
execution while sharing expensive fixtures (database connections,
service containers) via shared memory or Unix sockets. Changes span
`Framework/TestCase.php` for process forking,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for process management and result collection,
`Framework/TestSuite.php` for fixture sharing protocol,
`Event/Dispatcher.php` for cross-process event marshaling,
`Logging/` for aggregating results from child processes, and
`Util/` for IPC helper classes.

### W3: Implement extensible code coverage driver architecture

Add a `CoverageDriver` plugin interface that supports custom coverage
backends beyond Xdebug and PCOV — including AST-based instrumentation
and sampling profilers. Changes span new `Coverage/` directory with
driver interface and built-in implementations,
`TextUI/Configuration/Loader.php` for driver selection,
`TextUI/Command/Command.php` for `--coverage-driver` option,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for driver lifecycle management,
`Logging/` for coverage report generation with driver-specific data,
and `Metadata/` for `#[CoversClass]` integration with custom drivers.

### W4: Add real-time test result streaming over WebSocket

Implement a `--live` mode that starts a WebSocket server and streams
test events to connected clients in real-time. Support filtered
subscriptions per suite or test name pattern. Changes span
`TextUI/Command/Command.php` for the `--live` option,
new `TextUI/Output/Live/` WebSocket server classes,
`Event/Dispatcher.php` for streaming subscriber integration,
`Event/Events/` for serialization of all event types,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for server lifecycle management, and
`TextUI/Configuration/` for live output configuration.

### W5: Implement dependency injection container for test fixtures

Add a `#[Inject]` attribute for constructor and method parameter
injection using a lightweight DI container scoped per test suite.
Support factory registrations, singleton fixtures, and
auto-wiring from type hints. Changes span new
`Framework/DependencyInjection/` container classes,
`Metadata/Parser/AttributeParser.php` for `#[Inject]` parsing,
`Framework/TestCase.php` for injected construction,
`Framework/TestSuite.php` for container scoping,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for container lifecycle,
and `TextUI/Configuration/Loader.php` for XML-based service
registration.

### W6: Add parameterized test suite generation from external data sources

Implement `#[ExternalDataProvider(source: 'api://...')]` that fetches
test data from external sources (REST APIs, databases, CSV files) and
generates parameterized tests at suite construction time. Support
caching, schema validation, and incremental fetching. Changes span
`Framework/DataProvider/` for external source adapters, new
`Framework/DataProvider/External/` classes for each source type,
`Metadata/Parser/AttributeParser.php` for the new attribute,
`Runner/TestSuiteLoader.php` for deferred suite construction,
`TextUI/Configuration/` for source credentials and caching config,
and `Event/Events/` for data fetch lifecycle events.

### W7: Implement hierarchical test tagging with conditional execution

Add `#[Tag('slow', 'database')]` attribute with support for tag
expressions in `--filter` (e.g., `slow AND NOT database`, `ci OR
quick`). Implement tag inheritance through test class hierarchies and
suite nesting. Changes span `Metadata/Parser/AttributeParser.php`
for tag parsing, `Metadata/` for tag expression evaluation,
`Runner/Filter/` for tag-based filtering with boolean expressions,
`TextUI/Command/Command.php` for enhanced `--filter` syntax,
`TextUI/Configuration/Loader.php` for XML tag groups, and
`Runner/TestSuiteLoader.php` for tag-based suite pruning. Also update
`phpunit.xsd` to add a `<tagGroups>` element definition that allows
named tag groups to be defined in `phpunit.xml`, and update
`build.xml` to add a `tagged-tests` target that runs only tests
tagged with `ci` for fast feedback during development.

### W8: Add mutation testing integration with constraint-aware mutant detection

Implement `--mutation-testing` mode that instruments source code with
mutations and re-runs relevant tests to calculate mutation score.
Leverage `@covers` metadata to map tests to mutated code. Changes span
new `MutationTesting/` directory with mutator engine and operators,
`Metadata/Registry.php` for test-to-source mapping,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for selective test re-execution,
`Framework/Assert.php` for mutation-killed detection,
`Logging/` for mutation score reporting, and
`TextUI/Command/Command.php` for mutation testing configuration.

### W9: Implement test execution profiling with bottleneck analysis

Add `--profile` mode that instruments test execution to identify
performance bottlenecks: slow setUp/tearDown, expensive assertions,
mock generation time, and data provider computation. Generate flame
graph data and an HTML report. Changes span new `Profiling/` classes
for instrumentation and report generation,
`Framework/TestCase.php` for lifecycle timing hooks,
`Framework/Assert.php` for assertion duration tracking,
`MockObject/Generator/Generator.php` for generation timing,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for profiling lifecycle management, and
`TextUI/Output/` for profile summary display.

### W10: Add cross-suite test dependency resolution with topological ordering

Implement `#[DependsOnSuite('IntegrationTests')]` that models
dependencies between test suites and executes them in topological
order. Support cross-suite fixture sharing via a registry and
automatic skip propagation when a dependency suite fails. Changes span
`Metadata/Parser/AttributeParser.php` for suite dependency attributes,
`Framework/TestSuite.php` for dependency graph construction,
`Runner/TestSuiteLoader.php` for topological sorting,
`Runner/TestRunner.php` for ordered execution with skip propagation,
`Framework/TestCase.php` for cross-suite fixture access,
and `Event/Events/TestSuite/` for dependency lifecycle events.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration for the 14.0 release

Prepare the repository's non-code configuration for the PHPUnit 14.0
major release. Create `schema/14.0.xsd` by copying `schema/13.0.xsd`
and adding new elements for baseline configuration, tag groups, and
diff format settings. Update `phpunit.xsd` (the root-level schema)
to reflect the 14.0 structure. Update `phpunit.xml` to reference
the new schema via `xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="phpunit.xsd"`
and set `failOnPhpunitDeprecation="true"`. Update `DEPRECATIONS.md`
to add a "14.0 Hard Deprecations" section listing features scheduled
for removal. Update `build.xml` to add a `validate-schema` target
that runs `xmllint` against the XSD files in `schema/`. Update
`.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to bump the minimum PHP version to 8.5
in the matrix and add a schema validation step using the new Ant
target. Update `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` to add type-safety
requirements (all new code must pass PHPStan level 6) and reference
the updated `DEPRECATIONS.md`. Update `composer.json` to add
`phpstan/phpstan` to `require-dev` with version `^2.0` and add a
`scripts.phpstan` entry.
