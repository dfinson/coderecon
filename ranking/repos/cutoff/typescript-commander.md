## Why this repo

- **Minimal and well-structured**: Six source files under `lib/` —
  `command.js` (2777 lines, core Command class with parsing, help,
  subcommands), `option.js` (380 lines, Option/DualOptions),
  `argument.js` (150 lines, Argument), `help.js` (747 lines,
  HelpFormatter with column layout and color support), `error.js`
  (39 lines, CommanderError), and `suggestSimilar.js` (101 lines,
  Levenshtein-based suggestions). Clean EventEmitter-based architecture.
- **Widely used**: 27K+ stars, one of the most popular Node.js CLI
  libraries. Powers thousands of CLI tools.
- **Permissive**: MIT license.
- **Scale anchor**: Intentionally small to anchor the "Small" end of
  scale assessment.

## Tasks

33 tasks (11 narrow, 11 medium, 11 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Add option grouping in help output

Options in help text are listed in a flat list regardless of their
purpose. Add `option.helpGroup(name)` that assigns an option to a
named group, so `--help` output renders options under labeled sections
(e.g., "Output Options:", "Connection Options:"). Implement in
`option.js` for storage and `help.js` `formatHelp()` for grouped
rendering, falling back to the default list for ungrouped options.

### N2: Fix DualOptions not handling chained short flags correctly

The `DualOptions` class in `option.js` splits combined flags
(e.g., `--no-color`) into positive and negative forms. When a short
flag is combined with other short flags (e.g., `-vn` where `-n` is a
negated flag), `DualOptions` does not recognize the negation in the
combined context. Fix `DualOptions` to correctly detect negated short
flags within combined flag sequences.

### N3: Add option value history tracking

The `_optionValueSources` field in `command.js` tracks the source of
each option's value (default, env, cli, config) but only retains the
last source. When an option is specified multiple times (e.g., `-v -v`),
intermediate values are lost. Add `_optionValueHistory` that stores
an ordered list of `{source, value}` entries for each option, and
expose it via `getOptionValueHistory(name)`.

### N4: Fix suggestSimilar not handling camelCase option names

The `suggestSimilar()` function in `suggestSimilar.js` computes edit
distance on raw strings, which penalizes camelCase vs kebab-case
differences (e.g., `--outputDir` vs `--output-dir` has high edit
distance despite being semantically similar). Normalize option names
to lowercase-hyphenated form before computing distance, and match
against both the original and normalized forms.

### N5: Add required option validation with custom error messages

When a required option (`option.makeOptionMandatory()`) is missing,
the error message is generic. Add `option.mandatoryMessage(msg)` that
allows per-option custom error messages (e.g., "The --token option is
required for authentication. Set it or use TOKEN env var."). Implement
in `option.js` and use in `command.js` `_parseCommand()`. Add the
`mandatoryMessage(msg: string)` method signature to
`typings/index.d.ts` and add a type-level test case in
`typings/index.test-d.ts`.

### N6: Fix Help.wrap() breaking words inside ANSI escape sequences

The `wrap()` method in `help.js` wraps lines at the terminal width
but treats ANSI escape codes as visible characters when calculating
positions. This causes incorrect line breaks inside styled text.
Use `stripColor()` for width calculation while preserving the escape
sequences in the output, and handle the case where a break point
falls inside an escape sequence.

### N7: Add argument value validation callbacks

The `Argument` class in `argument.js` supports `argParser()` for
custom parsing but no standalone validation that runs after parsing and
before the action handler. Add `argument.validate(fn)` that accepts a
function receiving the parsed value and throwing
`InvalidArgumentError` on failure. Invoke it in `command.js` during
`_parseCommand()` after argument processing.

### N8: Fix option.env() not trimming whitespace from environment values

The `parseValueFromEnv()` method in `option.js` reads environment
variable values verbatim, including any trailing newline or whitespace
that may be present (e.g., from `export PORT="8080 "`). Trim
whitespace from environment variable values before processing them
through the option's `parseArg` function.

### N9: Add hidden arguments support

Options can be marked as hidden with `option.hideHelp()`, but the
`Argument` class in `argument.js` has no equivalent. Add
`argument.hideHelp()` that excludes the argument from the usage
line and help output while still accepting values during parsing.
Implement in `argument.js` and update `help.js` `commandUsage()` to
skip hidden arguments.

### N10: Fix Command.parse() not restoring state after error in nested subcommands

The `saveStateBeforeParse()` and `restoreStateBeforeParse()` methods
in `command.js` save and restore option values for re-parsing. But when
an error occurs in a nested subcommand, the parent command's state is
not restored, leaving stale parsed values from previous invocations.
Call `restoreStateBeforeParse()` in the error handling path of
`_parseCommand()` for all ancestor commands.

## Medium

### M1: Implement option dependency declarations

Add `option.implies({name: value, ...})` and
`option.dependsOn(otherOption)` for declaring relationships between
options. When `--format json` is set, it could imply `--no-color`.
When `--output` depends on `--format`, omitting `--format` should
produce a clear error. Requires post-parse validation in `command.js`,
dependency graph cycle detection, error messages in `error.js`, and
help text integration in `help.js`. Document the `implies()` and
`dependsOn()` API in `Readme.md` under a new "Option Dependencies"
section, and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry describing the feature.

### M2: Add config file support as a parameter source

Implement `command.configFile(path, format)` that reads option values
from JSON, YAML, or TOML configuration files. Config values should
have lower precedence than CLI arguments but higher than environment
variables and defaults. Track the config source in
`_optionValueSources`. Requires a config reader, integration with
option resolution in `command.js`, and conflict handling when multiple
config files are specified.

### M3: Implement interactive prompt mode for missing required options

Add `command.interactive()` that prompts the user for any required
options not provided on the command line. Use `readline` for text
input, present choices for options with `choices()`, and confirm
boolean flags. Support a `--no-interactive` flag to disable prompting
in CI environments. Requires changes to `command.js` for the prompt
loop, integration with option types, and output formatting.

### M4: Add structured output support for help text

Implement `command.helpAsJson()` and expose via `--help-json` (or
`helpFormat('json')`) that emits the help information as a structured
JSON object containing command name, description, options (with types,
defaults, choices, env vars), arguments, and subcommands. Requires
a new serialization path in `help.js` parallel to `formatHelp()` and
registration of the format flag as a special option.

### M5: Implement command versioning and deprecation lifecycle

Add `command.since(version)` and `command.deprecatedSince(version,
replacement)` metadata that displays in help text and emits warnings
when deprecated commands are invoked. Include a `command.removed(
version, message)` that throws a clear error. Requires metadata
storage in `command.js`, help output in `help.js`, and lifecycle
checks during `_parseCommand()`.

### M6: Add option value coercion with type system

Implement a type system for options: `option.type('number')`
automatically parses to `Number`, validates NaN, and displays
`<number>` in help. Built-in types: `number`, `integer`, `boolean`,
`path`, `url`, `date`. Custom types via `commander.type('port',
{parse, validate, display})`. Requires a type registry, integration
with `option.js` parsing, `argument.js`, `help.js` for display, and
`typings/index.d.ts` for TypeScript support.

### M7: Implement command aliases with completion support

Add `command.alias('rm')` that registers short aliases for
subcommands. Aliases should appear in help text alongside the primary
name, resolve during parsing, and be included in completion output.
Requires changes to `command.js` for alias registration and lookup,
`help.js` for formatting aliases in the subcommand list, and the
existing `_aliases` array handling for multiple alias registration.

### M8: Add middleware/hook system for command execution lifecycle

Implement `command.hook('preAction', fn)` and
`command.hook('postAction', fn)` for the full lifecycle: `preSubcommand`,
`preAction`, `postAction`. Support async hooks that return promises.
Extend the existing `_lifeCycleHooks` system with error handling hooks
(`onError`) and globally registered hooks that apply to all
subcommands. Requires changes to `command.js` invocation pipeline and
error handling.

### M9: Implement output format negotiation for commands

Add `command.outputFormat(format)` that configures output rendering.
When `--output json` is passed, the action handler receives a
`context.format` property and can return structured data that the
framework serializes. Built-in formatters: `json`, `table`, `csv`,
`yaml`. Requires a formatter registry, output pipeline in
`command.js`, and integration with `configureOutput()`.

### M10: Add progress reporting utilities for long-running commands

Implement `command.createProgress({total, label})` that returns a
progress bar object supporting `.tick()`, `.update(n)`, and
`.finish()`. Support spinners for indeterminate progress. Integrate
with the output configuration system (`configureOutput()`) and support
`--quiet` mode suppression. Requires a new progress module, terminal
cursor manipulation, and integration with the command lifecycle.

## Wide

### W1: Implement full shell completion generation

Add `command.generateCompletion('bash')` that produces bash, zsh, and
fish completion scripts from the command tree. Support dynamic
completions for options with runtime values, file path completions for
path-typed arguments, subcommand completions, and option value
completions from `choices()`. Include a `completions` subcommand
that outputs the script. Changes span `command.js` (tree traversal),
`help.js` (completion formatting), a new `completion.js` module, and
`typings/index.d.ts`.

### W2: Add comprehensive TypeScript support with generic type inference

Rewrite the type definitions so that `program.opts()` returns a typed
object inferred from registered options. Use template literal types
to parse option flag strings (`"-p, --port <number>"`) and infer types
from `parseArg` return types. Support nested subcommand typing and
action handler parameter inference. Changes span `typings/index.d.ts`,
`typings/index.test-d.ts`, potentially a TypeScript implementation of
core modules, and the ESM/CJS entry points.

### W3: Implement a plugin and extension system

Add `command.use(plugin)` that accepts plugin objects with `install(
command)` methods. Plugins can register options, subcommands, hooks,
and custom types. Support plugin ordering, conflict detection for
overlapping registrations, and a plugin API for accessing internal
state. Include a `plugin list` subcommand. Changes span `command.js`
(plugin lifecycle), a new `plugin.js` module, `help.js` (plugin
attribution), error handling, and type definitions.

### W4: Implement command testing framework

Add a `TestRunner` class (analogous to Click's `CliRunner`) that
invokes commands programmatically with simulated argv, captures
stdout/stderr/exit code, provides mock stdin for interactive prompts,
and supports snapshot testing for help text. Include assertion helpers
and integration with common test frameworks (Jest, Mocha). Changes
span a new `testing.js` module, the command invocation pipeline, output
capture, stdin simulation, and type definitions.

### W5: Add automatic documentation generation

Implement `command.generateDocs({format: 'markdown'})` that produces
Markdown, man pages (roff), or HTML documentation from the command
tree. Support full subcommand hierarchies with cross-references,
option tables, examples, environment variable documentation, and exit
code documentation. Changes span a new `docs.js` module, `help.js`
(structured extraction), `command.js` metadata access, template
rendering, and type definitions.

### W6: Implement internationalization for help and error messages

Add i18n support: all built-in strings ("Usage:", "Options:",
"Commands:", error messages) should be translatable via locale files
or a custom message function. Support user-provided translations for
option descriptions and command summaries. Include locale detection
from `LANG`/`LC_ALL` environment variables. Changes span `help.js`,
`error.js`, `command.js`, a new `i18n.js` module with message
catalogs, and type definitions.

### W7: Implement command workflow orchestration

Add `command.workflow(steps)` that defines multi-step command
execution with dependency ordering, parallel execution of independent
steps, progress reporting, rollback on failure, and dry-run mode.
Each step is a command or function with declared inputs/outputs.
Changes span `command.js` (workflow registration), a new `workflow.js`
module, progress reporting, error handling/rollback, the hook system,
and type definitions.

### W8: Add remote command execution support

Implement `command.remote({host, transport: 'ssh'})` that proxies
command execution to remote machines. Support argument serialization
over SSH or HTTP, stdout/stderr streaming, exit code propagation, and
secure credential handling. Include a lightweight agent script for
the remote side. Changes span a new `remote.js` module, `command.js`
dispatch, serialization, transport layers (SSH/HTTP), error handling,
and type definitions.

### W9: Implement visual CLI builder and introspection UI

Add `command.inspect()` that launches a terminal UI showing the
command tree, registered options with their current values/sources,
argument definitions, and hook registrations. Support interactive
exploration via keyboard navigation, option value editing, and
test invocation. Changes span a new `inspector.js` module, terminal
UI rendering (box drawing, colors), `command.js` introspection API,
key handling, and type definitions.

### W10: Add API-first mode with HTTP server generation

Implement `command.serve({port: 3000})` that exposes the CLI as an
HTTP API. Each command maps to a route, options map to query
parameters or JSON body fields, and responses include stdout, stderr,
and exit code. Include OpenAPI spec generation, authentication
middleware, rate limiting, and CORS support. Changes span a new
`server.js` module, route generation from the command tree, request
parsing, response serialization, `command.js` invocation, and type
definitions.

### N11: Fix jest.config.js not collecting coverage for all library source files

The `jest.config.js` configuration collects coverage from files in
`lib/` but the `collectCoverageFrom` patterns omit
`lib/suggestSimilar.js` and `lib/error.js`. Changes to these files
show 0% coverage in reports. Add the missing file patterns to
`collectCoverageFrom` in `jest.config.js`. Also update
`.github/workflows/tests.yml` to add a coverage upload step and
publish coverage results as a PR comment.

### M11: Add comprehensive example documentation and project configuration

Create a `docs/examples/` directory with documented usage examples for
all major features: subcommands, option choices, custom argument
parsing, error handling, and help customization. Each example should be
a standalone `.js` file that can be run directly. Update `Readme.md` to
link to each example with a brief description. Add a `docs:generate`
script to `package.json` that generates API documentation from
`typings/index.d.ts`. Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include a section on
how to add and test new examples. Update `tsconfig.json` to include the
`examples/` directory for type checking. Add missing content to
`SECURITY.md` with a vulnerability disclosure timeline.

### W11: Overhaul CI/CD pipeline, documentation, and project configuration

Expand `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to add separate jobs for type
checking (running both `tsconfig.js.json` and `tsconfig.ts.json`), a
linting job using `eslint.config.js`, and a documentation build
verification job. Add a `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated
npm publishing with provenance. Create a `docs/migration/` directory
with `v11-to-v12.md` and `v12-to-v13.md` migration guides covering
API changes, renamed methods, and updated option parsing behavior.
Update `CHANGELOG.md` structure to follow Keep a Changelog format with
categorized entries (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed,
Security). Update `package.json` to add an `engines` field specifying
minimum Node.js version, a `packageManager` field, and `funding`
configuration. Add `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency
updates on a weekly schedule. Update `.prettierrc.js` to enforce
consistent formatting across `lib/`, `typings/`, `examples/`, and
`docs/`. Update `.editorconfig` to add settings for `.mjs` and `.d.ts`
files.
