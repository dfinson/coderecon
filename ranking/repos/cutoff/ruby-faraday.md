## Why this repo

- **Well-structured**: Rack-inspired middleware architecture —
  `Connection` (manages URL prefix, headers, params, SSL, proxy,
  middleware stack), `RackBuilder` (ordered middleware stack with
  `use`, `request`, `response`, `adapter` DSL), `Middleware` (base
  class with `on_request`/`on_complete` hooks), `Adapter` (base class
  for HTTP backends), `Request`/`Response` (Rack-like env objects),
  `Env` (request/response state container), encoders
  (`NestedParamsEncoder`, `FlatParamsEncoder`), error hierarchy, and
  built-in middleware (`Authorization`, `UrlEncoded`, `Json`,
  `RaiseError`, `Logger`, `Instrumentation`).
- **Rich history**: 5.7K+ stars, 1.1K+ commits. The standard HTTP
  client abstraction for Ruby, used by Octokit, Stripe, and hundreds
  of gems. Issues span middleware ordering, encoding edge cases,
  proxy handling, and adapter compatibility.
- **Permissive**: MIT licensed.

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix Connection#build_url not preserving fragment identifiers

In `lib/faraday/connection.rb`, the `build_url` method constructs a
full URL by merging `url_prefix` with the provided path and params.
URL fragments (e.g., `#section`) in the path argument are silently
stripped during URI parsing. Fix `build_url` to preserve fragment
identifiers when present in the path, passing them through to the
final URI.

### N2: Fix Headers#replace not maintaining case-insensitive key lookup for replaced headers

In `lib/faraday/utils/headers.rb`, the `Headers` class provides
case-insensitive key access. When `replace(new_hash)` is called to
bulk-replace all headers, the internal `@names` mapping (which tracks
the canonical case) is not rebuilt. Subsequent lookups for keys with
different casing fail. Fix `replace` to rebuild the `@names` hash
from the new headers.

### N3: Fix RaiseError middleware not including response headers in the exception

In `lib/faraday/response/raise_error.rb`, the `RaiseError` middleware
raises `Faraday::ClientError` or `Faraday::ServerError` with the
response body, but the response headers are not attached to the
exception object. Downstream error handlers cannot access rate-limit
headers (e.g., `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`). Fix
`RaiseError` to include the response headers in the raised exception
via the existing `response` attribute hash. Also update
`CHANGELOG.md` to document this behavioral change and update
`docs/middleware/included/raising-errors.md` (or its parent
`docs/middleware/index.md`) to note that response headers are now
available on the exception object.

### N4: Fix NestedParamsEncoder not encoding boolean values correctly

In `lib/faraday/encoders/nested_params_encoder.rb`,
`NestedParamsEncoder.encode` converts parameter values to strings
via `to_s`. Ruby's `true.to_s` produces `"true"` and `false.to_s`
produces `"false"`, but some APIs expect `"1"`/`"0"` or have custom
boolean serialization. More critically, `nil` values are encoded as
the string `""` when they should be omitted entirely per HTTP
conventions. Fix the encoder to omit `nil`-valued parameters instead
of encoding empty strings.

### N5: Fix ProxyOptions.from not parsing proxy credentials from URI string

In `lib/faraday/options/proxy_options.rb`, `ProxyOptions.from(string)`
parses a proxy URL string like `"http://user:pass@proxy:8080"` into
a `ProxyOptions` instance. The `user` and `password` fields are
extracted from the URI but not URI-decoded, so special characters
in credentials (e.g., `%40` for `@`) remain encoded. Fix `from` to
URI-decode `user` and `password` after extraction from the URI.

### N6: Fix Connection#initialize not validating URL scheme

In `lib/faraday/connection.rb`, the `Connection` initializer accepts
any string as the base URL without validating the scheme. Passing a
URL without a scheme (e.g., `"example.com/api"`) silently creates a
connection with `url_prefix` set to `"http:/example.com/api"` (note
single slash from the default `"http:/"`). Fix the initializer to
validate that the URL has a recognized scheme (`http` or `https`)
and raise `ArgumentError` for invalid URLs.

### N7: Fix Json request middleware not setting Content-Type when body is already a string

In `lib/faraday/request/json.rb`, the `Json` middleware checks if
the request body responds to `to_json` and serializes it. When the
body is already a JSON string (plain `String`), the middleware skips
serialization but also skips setting the `Content-Type` header to
`application/json`. Fix the middleware to always set the content
type header when the request body is a non-empty string and no
content type is already set.

### N8: Fix Test adapter stubs not matching requests with query parameters in the path

In `lib/faraday/adapter/test.rb`, the `Test` adapter matches stubs
by HTTP method and path. When a stub is registered with a path
containing query parameters (e.g., `get("/api?page=1")`) and the
actual request has the same query parameters in the `params` hash
instead of the path string, the stub does not match. Fix the stub
matching logic to normalize both stub and request paths by
extracting and comparing query parameters separately.

### N9: Fix Authorization middleware Bearer token not being refreshed for retried requests

In `lib/faraday/request/authorization.rb`, the `Authorization`
middleware supports a callable (`Proc`) for the token parameter
to allow dynamic token generation. However, when a request is
retried (e.g., by a retry middleware), the token proc is not
re-evaluated because the header is already set from the first
attempt. Fix the middleware to always re-evaluate the proc on
each `on_request` call, replacing any existing `Authorization`
header.

### N10: Fix FlatParamsEncoder.decode not handling duplicate keys

In `lib/faraday/encoders/flat_params_encoder.rb`,
`FlatParamsEncoder.decode` parses a query string into a hash. When
the query contains duplicate keys (e.g., `"a=1&a=2"`), only the
last value is retained. Fix `decode` to collect duplicate keys into
arrays, matching the behavior of `NestedParamsEncoder.decode`.

### N11: Fix docs/getting-started/quick-start.md containing outdated default adapter references

The `docs/getting-started/quick-start.md` guide references
`Faraday.default_adapter = :net_http` as optional, but since Faraday
2.x the `net_http` adapter is bundled and no longer requires separate
configuration. The guide also omits the `faraday-net_http` gem
dependency note that appears in the `README.md`. Additionally, the
`.rubocop_todo.yml` contains stale `Metrics/MethodLength` exclusions
for files that were refactored in 2.x. Fix `docs/getting-started/quick-start.md`
to reflect the current adapter defaults, reconcile the dependency
instructions with `README.md`, and clean up the stale entries in
`.rubocop_todo.yml`.

## Medium

### M1: Implement request retry middleware with configurable backoff

Add `Faraday::Request::Retry` middleware that retries failed requests
with configurable retry count, backoff strategy (linear, exponential),
retryable status codes, and exception types. Requires a new
`lib/faraday/request/retry.rb` file, registration in
`middleware_registry.rb`, `RackBuilder` integration via
`builder.request :retry`, timeout-aware retry logic, idempotency
checking (skip retry for POST by default), spec coverage, a new
`docs/middleware/included/retry.md` documentation page describing
configuration options and backoff strategies, an entry in
`docs/middleware/index.md` linking to the retry docs, and an
`UPGRADING.md` note for users migrating from third-party retry gems.

### M2: Add request/response caching middleware with ETag support

Implement `Faraday::Middleware::Cache` that caches GET responses
using ETags and `If-None-Match` headers. Requires a new
`lib/faraday/middleware/cache.rb` file, cache store abstraction
(in-memory `Hash` default), ETag extraction and conditional request
logic, `304 Not Modified` handling, cache-control header parsing,
middleware registration, and specs.

### M3: Implement multipart file upload middleware

Add `Faraday::Request::Multipart` middleware that handles multipart
form data encoding for file uploads. Requires a new
`lib/faraday/request/multipart.rb` file, `Faraday::FilePart` and
`Faraday::ParamPart` value classes, MIME boundary generation,
multipart body assembly from mixed hash parameters, content-type
header setting, streaming support for large files, and middleware
registration.

### M4: Add circuit breaker middleware for fault tolerance

Implement `Faraday::Middleware::CircuitBreaker` that tracks failure
rates and opens the circuit after a threshold, returning errors
immediately without making requests. Requires
`lib/faraday/middleware/circuit_breaker.rb`, state machine
(closed/open/half-open), configurable failure threshold and reset
timeout, thread-safe state tracking, custom fallback response
support, and specs.

### M5: Implement request signing middleware for HMAC authentication

Add `Faraday::Request::HmacAuth` middleware that signs requests
using HMAC-SHA256 with configurable key, secret, and signed headers.
Requires `lib/faraday/request/hmac_auth.rb`, canonical request
string construction, HMAC signature computation, header injection,
timestamp verification support, middleware registration, and specs.

### M6: Add response body streaming support with chunked transfer

Implement `Faraday::Response::Stream` middleware that yields response
body chunks to a block as they arrive instead of buffering the
entire response. Requires `lib/faraday/response/stream.rb`,
`on_data` callback integration with `Env`, adapter-level streaming
support in `adapter.rb`, `Connection#get` with block for streaming,
content-length vs. chunked handling, and specs.

### M7: Implement connection pooling with keep-alive support

Add `Faraday::ConnectionPool` that maintains a pool of persistent
connections for connection reuse. Requires
`lib/faraday/connection_pool.rb`, per-host connection tracking,
configurable pool size and idle timeout, thread-safe checkout/checkin,
integration with `Connection` via an option, adapter-level
persistent connection support, and specs.

### M8: Add OAuth 2.0 middleware with token refresh flow

Implement `Faraday::Request::OAuth2` middleware that adds Bearer
tokens and automatically refreshes expired tokens using the refresh
token grant. Requires `lib/faraday/request/oauth2.rb`, token storage
abstraction, expiry detection from `401` responses, automatic retry
after token refresh, thread-safe token refresh (single-flight),
middleware registration, and specs.

### M9: Implement request/response compression middleware

Add `Faraday::Middleware::Gzip` that compresses request bodies and
decompresses response bodies using gzip/deflate. Requires
`lib/faraday/middleware/gzip.rb`, `Accept-Encoding` header injection,
`Content-Encoding` header detection on responses, `Zlib` integration
for compression/decompression, streaming decompression support,
content-type preservation, and specs.

### M10: Add response body validation middleware with JSON Schema

Implement `Faraday::Response::Validate` middleware that validates
JSON responses against a schema. Requires
`lib/faraday/response/validate.rb`, JSON Schema loading from
files or inline, validation logic with error collection,
configurable behavior (raise vs. warn), schema caching by URL
pattern, middleware registration, and specs.

### M11: Update UPGRADING.md and docs/ for middleware deprecation notices

The `UPGRADING.md` file does not document the deprecation of
positional arguments in `Faraday.new` (keyword arguments are now
preferred), and the `docs/customization/` section lacks a guide on
migrating custom middleware from the v1 API to v2. The
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` does not include a checklist item
for updating documentation when adding new middleware. Update
`UPGRADING.md` with a deprecation table and migration examples,
add `docs/customization/migration-v1-to-v2.md` covering middleware
API changes, and add a documentation checklist item to
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

circuit state, `Connection` configuration for backend list,
automatic retry on backend failure, and specs.

### W11: Overhaul docs/ documentation site and CI configuration

The `docs/` documentation site (served via docsify with
`docs/index.html`) is missing coverage for several built-in
middleware and adapter combinations. The `docs/_sidebar.md`
navigation does not include links for the `Authorization`,
`Instrumentation`, or `Json` middleware pages. The
`docs/adapters/index.md` adapter overview does not mention the
test adapter. The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` CI workflow does not
run on documentation-only PRs (no path filter), wasting CI minutes,
and the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishing workflow lacks a
step to validate documentation links. Overhaul `docs/_sidebar.md`
to include all middleware and adapter pages, add missing
`docs/adapters/test-adapter.md` and middleware documentation pages,
add a path filter to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and add a
link-checking step to `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
