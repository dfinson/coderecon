## Why this repo

- **Composable strategy architecture**: V8+ redesigned around
  `ResiliencePipeline` and composable strategies — each strategy
  (Retry, CircuitBreaker, Timeout, Hedging, RateLimiter, Fallback)
  is a self-contained module with options, internal state, and
  telemetry integration. Tasks require navigating across strategy
  boundaries, the pipeline builder, and the telemetry/registry layers.
- **Well-structured**: Source under `src/Polly.Core/` with clear
  per-strategy directories (`Retry/`, `CircuitBreaker/`, `Timeout/`,
  `RateLimiter/`, `Hedging/`, `Fallback/`), shared infrastructure
  in `Telemetry/` and `Registry/`, and the pipeline builder as the
  composition root.
- **Rich history**: 13K+ stars, widely adopted in .NET microservice
  architectures. Issues span correctness under concurrency, strategy
  composition edge cases, and telemetry fidelity.
- **Permissive**: BSD-3-Clause license.

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix RetryHelper jitter calculation producing negative delays

`RetryHelper.GetRetryDelay()` applies jitter by subtracting a random
value from the base delay, but for small base delays with high jitter
factors, the result can go negative, producing an `ArgumentOutOfRange
Exception` in `Task.Delay()`. Fix the jitter calculation in
`RetryHelper.cs` to clamp the result to `TimeSpan.Zero` minimum.

### N2: Fix CircuitBreakerManualControl.IsolateAsync not respecting cancellation

`CircuitBreakerManualControl.IsolateAsync()` transitions the circuit
to `Isolated` state but does not check the `CancellationToken` from
the `ResilienceContext`. If the token is already cancelled, the
isolation proceeds silently instead of throwing
`OperationCanceledException`. Fix to check cancellation before state
transition.

### N3: Fix TimeoutResilienceStrategy not disposing linked CancellationTokenSource

When a timeout fires, `TimeoutResilienceStrategy` creates a linked
`CancellationTokenSource` but does not dispose it in the non-timeout
path. Under high throughput, this causes handle exhaustion. Fix the
strategy to always dispose the linked token source via `finally` or
the `CancellationTokenSourcePool`.

### N4: Fix ResilienceContext.ContinueOnCapturedContext not propagated to hedging actions

When `ResilienceContext.ContinueOnCapturedContext` is set to `false`,
the hedging strategy ignores it for spawned hedging actions, causing
them to resume on the captured `SynchronizationContext`. Fix
`HedgingResilienceStrategy.cs` to propagate the context setting to
each hedging action's inner context.

### N5: Fix RetryDelayGeneratorArguments not including previous attempt execution duration

`RetryDelayGeneratorArguments` provides the attempt number and outcome
to custom delay generators but does not include the execution duration
of the previous attempt. Delay generators that want to implement
latency-adaptive backoff (e.g., increasing delay when the upstream
is slow) must track timing externally. Fix
`RetryDelayGeneratorArguments.cs` to add a `Duration` property and
populate it from the execution time measured in
`RetryResilienceStrategy.cs`, matching the `Duration` already
available on `OnRetryArguments`.

### N6: Fix FallbackResilienceStrategy swallowing original exception stack trace

When `FallbackResilienceStrategy` catches an exception and invokes the
fallback handler, the original exception's stack trace is lost because
it is stored only as `Outcome.Exception` without preservation. Fix the
fallback to use `ExceptionDispatchInfo` to preserve the original stack
trace when re-throwing after a failed fallback.

### N7: Fix RetryStrategyOptions.OnRetry delegate receiving wrong attempt number

The `OnRetryArguments.AttemptNumber` passed to the `OnRetry` delegate
starts at 1 instead of 0 for the first retry, inconsistent with the
documentation and `MaxRetryAttempts` counting. Fix
`RetryResilienceStrategy.cs` to use zero-based attempt numbering.

### N8: Fix ResiliencePipelineBuilder.AddStrategy not validating null options

`ResiliencePipelineBuilder.AddStrategy()` accepts a `null`
`ResilienceStrategyOptions` without throwing, leading to a
`NullReferenceException` deep in the pipeline construction. Fix the
builder to validate options with `ArgumentNullException` at the
`AddStrategy` call site.

### N9: Fix OnCircuitOpenedArguments not including the failure rate that triggered the transition

`OnCircuitOpenedArguments` carries the break duration, outcome, and
manual flag but does not include the failure rate or failure count from
the health metrics sampling window that caused the circuit to open.
Subscribers to the `OnOpened` callback cannot assess the severity of
the failure pattern or verify which threshold was crossed. Fix
`OnCircuitOpenedArguments.cs` to add `FailureRate` and `FailureCount`
properties, and populate them from the health metrics in
`CircuitStateController.cs` when the circuit transitions to `Open`.

### N10: Fix TelemetryUtil not including pipeline name in enriched tags

`TelemetryUtil` emits telemetry events with strategy name and type
but omits the `ResiliencePipeline` name from the tags. When multiple
pipelines use the same strategy type, events are indistinguishable.
Fix `TelemetryUtil.cs` to include the pipeline instance name from
`ResilienceContext.Properties`.

## Medium

### M1: Add progressive delay backoff type to RetryHelper

Implement `DelayBackoffType.Progressive` that starts with a configured
initial delay, then advances by a fixed additive increment per attempt
(e.g., 100ms → 300ms → 500ms → 700ms). Unlike `Linear` which uses
multiples of the base delay, `Progressive` uses an absolute step. The
algorithm needs an `Increment` property on `RetryStrategyOptions`.
Changes span `DelayBackoffType.cs` for the new enum value,
`RetryHelper.cs` for the calculation, `RetryStrategyOptions.cs` for
the new `Increment` property, `RetryConstants.cs` for defaults, and
`RetryResilienceStrategy.cs` for wiring the increment into delay
generation.

### M2: Implement circuit breaker manual health reset with cold-start protection

Add `CircuitBreakerManualControl.ResetHealthAsync()` that transitions
the circuit from `Open` to `Closed` but enters a cold-start period
where the `FailureRatio` threshold is temporarily raised (e.g., doubled)
for the first `SamplingDuration` window to avoid immediately re-opening
from residual errors. Requires changes to
`CircuitBreakerManualControl.cs` for the new method,
`CircuitStateController.cs` for the cold-start state tracking,
`AdvancedCircuitBehavior.cs` for threshold adjustment during cold-start,
and `CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions.cs` for a configurable cold-start
ratio multiplier.

### M3: Add ResiliencePipeline execution result metadata

Implement `ResilienceExecutionResult<T>` that wraps the outcome with
execution metadata: total duration, attempt count, strategies invoked,
circuit state consulted, and whether a fallback was used. Add
`ResiliencePipeline.ExecuteWithResult<T>()`. Changes span
`ResiliencePipeline.cs`, `ResiliencePipeline.TResult.cs`, new result
metadata classes, and each strategy for metadata Population.

### M4: Implement dynamic strategy reconfiguration at runtime

Add `ResiliencePipelineRegistry.Reconfigure<T>()` that updates a
named pipeline's strategy options without rebuilding the pipeline.
Strategy instances must support hot-swapping their options via an
`IReconfigurable<TOptions>` interface. Changes span `Registry/` for
the reconfiguration API, `ResilienceStrategyOptions.cs` for the
interface, and each strategy class (`Retry`, `CircuitBreaker`,
`Timeout`) for reconfiguration support.

### M5: Add hedging action result selection strategy

Extend `HedgingStrategyOptions` with a `ResultSelector` delegate that
chooses the best result from completed hedging actions instead of
always taking the first successful one. Support scoring functions and
quorum-based selection. Changes span `HedgingStrategyOptions.cs`,
`HedgingResilienceStrategy.cs` for parallel result collection,
`HedgingHandler.cs` for selector invocation, and
`HedgingActionGeneratorArguments.cs` for context.

### M6: Implement outcome event notification system for pipeline observability

Add `ResiliencePipelineBuilder.OnOutcome(Action<OutcomeEventArgs>)`
that registers a callback invoked after each strategy in the pipeline
produces an outcome, carrying the strategy name, outcome
(result or exception), duration, and attempt metadata. Support
multiple subscribers with ordering guarantees. Changes span
`ResiliencePipelineBuilder.cs` for the registration API, new
`OutcomeEventArgs.cs` and `OutcomeEventNotifier.cs` classes,
`ResilienceStrategy.cs` for notifier injection, each strategy class
(`Retry`, `Timeout`, `Fallback`) for emitting events, and
`Telemetry/TelemetryUtil.cs` for bridging with existing telemetry.

### M7: Add per-strategy timeout support to ResiliencePipeline

Implement a pipeline-level overall timeout that wraps all strategies,
independent of the per-operation `TimeoutResilienceStrategy`. Add
`ResiliencePipelineBuilder.WithPipelineTimeout(TimeSpan)`. Changes span
`ResiliencePipelineBuilder.cs` for the configuration,
`ResiliencePipeline.cs` for the wrapping logic,
`ResilienceContext.cs` for remaining-time tracking, and
`CancellationTokenSourcePool.cs` for linked-source management.

### M8: Implement outcome predicate composition for strategies

Add fluent predicate builders:
`RetryStrategyOptions.HandleResult<T>(Func<T, bool>)`,
`.Handle<TException>()`, `.OrResult()`, `.OrHandle()` that compose
into a single `ShouldHandle` predicate. Replace the current raw
delegate assignment. Changes span `ResilienceStrategyOptions.cs` for
the builder base, each strategy's options class for the typed
overloads, and each strategy's core class for predicate evaluation.

### M9: Add circuit breaker state change notifications via IObservable

Implement `CircuitBreakerManualControl.StateChanges` as an
`IObservable<CircuitState>` that emits on every state transition.
Support `IAsyncObserver` for async subscribers. Changes span
`CircuitBreakerManualControl.cs`, `CircuitStateController.cs` for
event firing, `CircuitBreakerResilienceStrategy.cs` for wiring, and
new observable infrastructure in `Utils/`.

### M10: Implement strategy execution weight for load balancing

Add `ResilienceStrategyOptions.Weight` property used by the pipeline
to distribute load across multiple instances of the same strategy
type. Support weighted round-robin and least-connections strategies.
Changes span `ResilienceStrategyOptions.cs` for the weight property,
`ResiliencePipelineBuilder.cs` for multi-instance registration,
`ResiliencePipeline.cs` for the selection algorithm, and telemetry
for weight-based metrics.

## Wide

### W1: Implement distributed circuit breaker with shared state

Extend `CircuitBreakerResilienceStrategy` to support distributed state
via a pluggable `ICircuitBreakerStateStore` interface with
implementations for Redis and SQL Server. Shared state must handle
concurrent transitions across processes, lease-based half-open probes,
and eventual consistency. Changes span `CircuitBreaker/` for the state
store abstraction, `CircuitStateController.cs` for distributed locking,
`Registry/` for distributed pipeline registration, `Telemetry/` for
cross-process event correlation, and new persistence infrastructure.

### W2: Add OpenTelemetry-native instrumentation throughout the pipeline

Replace `DiagnosticSource`-based telemetry with native OpenTelemetry
`Activity` and `Meter` instrumentation. Emit spans for each strategy
execution with attributes (attempt number, circuit state, delay,
outcome), counters for retries/circuit-breaks/timeouts/rate-limits,
and histograms for execution duration. Changes span every strategy
class, `Telemetry/` for the OTel integration, `ResiliencePipeline.cs`
for span lifecycle, `ResilienceContext.cs` for baggage propagation,
and `Registry/` for meter management.

### W3: Implement adaptive concurrency limiter strategy

Add `AdaptiveConcurrencyStrategy` that dynamically adjusts concurrency
limits based on latency percentiles (gradient algorithm inspired by
Netflix's adaptive concurrency library). Track in-flight requests,
p99 latency, and adjust limits using AIMD. Changes span a new
`AdaptiveConcurrency/` directory, integration with
`ResiliencePipelineBuilder.cs`, `ResilienceContext.cs` for timing,
`Telemetry/` for limit-change events, `RateLimiter/` for shared
rate-limiting infrastructure, and `Utils/` for percentile tracking.

### W4: Add resilience pipeline composition with dependency graph

Implement `ResiliencePipelineBuilder.AddDependency(pipeline)` that
models inter-pipeline dependencies (e.g., service A depends on service
B). Propagate circuit-breaker state across dependent pipelines — if
a downstream circuit opens, upstream pipelines preemptively shed load.
Changes span `ResiliencePipelineBuilder.cs`, `ResiliencePipeline.cs`
for dependency tracking, `CircuitBreaker/` for state propagation,
`Registry/` for dependency graph management, `Telemetry/` for
cascade visualization, and `Hedging/` for dependency-aware action
generation.

### W5: Implement policy-as-code with JSON/YAML configuration

Add `ResiliencePipelineBuilder.FromConfiguration(IConfiguration)` that
builds pipelines from structured configuration (JSON, YAML, or
`IConfiguration`). Support all strategy types, custom predicate
expressions, and hot-reload via `IOptionsMonitor`. Changes span a new
`Configuration/` directory, `ResiliencePipelineBuilder.cs` for the
configuration binding, each strategy's options class for serialization
attributes, `Registry/` for configuration-based pipeline registration,
and validation logic for configuration schema.

### W6: Add request hedging with circuit-breaker-aware endpoint selection

Extend the hedging strategy to receive a list of endpoints and select
which ones to hedge against based on per-endpoint circuit breaker
state. Endpoints with open circuits are deprioritized. Add
`HedgingStrategyOptions.EndpointSelector` and per-endpoint health
tracking. Changes span `Hedging/` for the endpoint model and selector,
`CircuitBreaker/` for per-endpoint state, `Registry/` for endpoint
registration, `Telemetry/` for per-endpoint metrics, and
`ResiliencePipeline.cs` for endpoint-aware execution.

### W7: Implement resilience testing framework

Add `Polly.Testing` utilities: `ResiliencePipelineAssert` for verifying
pipeline composition (assert retry count, circuit threshold, timeout
value), `SimulatedClock` for deterministic time control,
`FaultInjectionContext` for scripted failure sequences, and
`TelemetryCollector` for asserting on emitted events. Changes span a
new `Testing/` directory, integration with `Telemetry/` for event
capture, `Utils/TimeProvider.cs` for clock injection, each strategy
for inspectable state, and `ResiliencePipeline.cs` for composition
introspection.

### W8: Add service mesh integration layer

Implement `Polly.Mesh` that bridges Polly resilience pipelines with
service mesh policies (Istio, Linkerd): sync circuit breaker state
with mesh-level outlier detection, respect mesh-injected retry budgets,
and propagate resilience headers (`x-retry-attempt`, `x-circuit-state`).
Changes span a new `Mesh/` integration layer, `ResilienceContext.cs`
for header propagation, `CircuitBreaker/` for external state sync,
`Retry/` for budget awareness, `Hedging/` for mesh endpoint discovery,
and `Telemetry/` for mesh-correlated spans.

### W9: Implement multi-tier resilience pipeline (inner/outer/cross-cutting)

Add `ResiliencePipelineBuilder.WrapWith()` composition that explicitly
models inner (per-call), outer (per-service), and cross-cutting
(global) resilience tiers. Each tier has its own telemetry scope and
can override or augment strategies from other tiers. Support
tier-aware circuit breaker aggregation. Changes span
`ResiliencePipelineBuilder.cs` for tier modeling,
`ResiliencePipeline.cs` for nested execution, every strategy for
tier-aware context, `Telemetry/` for per-tier metrics, and
`Registry/` for tiered pipeline management.

### W10: Add persistent execution log with replay capability

Implement `ResiliencePipeline.ExecuteWithLog<T>()` that persists every
execution attempt, outcome, delay, and strategy decision to a durable
log. Add `ExecutionLog.Replay()` that re-executes a logged sequence
for debugging. Support pluggable storage (file, database, event hub).
Changes span new `ExecutionLog/` infrastructure, integration with
`ResiliencePipeline.cs` and each strategy for event recording,
`ResilienceContext.cs` for log correlation, `Telemetry/` for log-based
metrics reconstruction, and `Registry/` for log configuration.

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in samples/Chaos/appsettings.json

The project configuration file `samples/Chaos/appsettings.json` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in samples/Chaos/appsettings.json, and update docs/index.md to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `docs/pipelines/index.md`, `docs/pipelines/resilience-pipeline-registry.md`, `samples/Chaos/appsettings.json`, `samples/Chaos/appsettings.Development.json`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
