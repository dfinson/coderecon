## Why this repo

- **Well-structured**: Clean single-package layout under `rich/` with
  per-concern modules — console output (`console.py`), styled text
  (`text.py`), color system (`color.py`, `style.py`), tables
  (`table.py`), panels (`panel.py`), trees (`tree.py`), syntax
  highlighting (`syntax.py`), markdown rendering (`markdown.py`),
  progress bars (`progress.py`), live display (`live.py`), and
  tracebacks (`traceback.py`). One developer can follow the full
  render pipeline from widget to terminal segments.
- **Rich history**: 5K+ commits, 50K+ stars. The most widely used
  Python terminal formatting library. PRs cover rendering edge cases,
  new renderables, and style system extensions.
- **Permissive**: MIT license.

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Add overflow strategy parameter to Panel for long content

When content inside a `Panel` exceeds the panel width, it is wrapped
by default, but there is no option to truncate with an ellipsis or crop
instead. Add an `overflow` parameter to `Panel.__init__()` in `panel.py`
that accepts `"wrap"`, `"ellipsis"`, or `"crop"` and passes it through
to the renderable's `ConsoleOptions` so content wider than the panel is
handled according to the chosen strategy.

### N2: Add Style.subtract() method for removing specific attributes

The `Style` class in `style.py` supports combining styles via `__add__`
but has no way to selectively remove attributes (e.g., remove `bold`
from a combined style while keeping color and italic). Add a
`Style.subtract(other)` method that returns a new `Style` with attributes
from `other` cleared, useful for style overrides in nested renderables
where a child needs to undo a parent's styling.

### N3: Add named color alias registry to Color class

The `Color` class in `color.py` supports standard named colors and hex
codes but does not allow users to register custom named aliases (e.g.,
`"brand-primary"` → `"#336699"`). Add a `Color.register_alias(name, color_str)`
class method that stores aliases in a module-level dictionary consulted
by `Color.parse()` before falling back to the standard color lookup,
so themes can define semantic color names. Also update `CHANGELOG.md` to document the new alias registration API with usage examples.

### N4: Fix Table not rendering empty cells when show_lines=True

When a `Table` has `show_lines=True` and a cell contains an empty
string, the row separator lines are misaligned because the empty cell
is measured as zero height instead of one line. Fix the cell height
calculation in `table.py` to ensure empty cells occupy at least one
line when `show_lines` is enabled.

### N5: Add escape_markup() utility to markup module

The `markup.py` module provides `render()` for parsing markup tags, but
there is no public utility to escape literal bracket characters in
user-provided strings before interpolation into markup templates. Add
`escape_markup(text)` to `markup.py` that replaces `[` with `\[` so
user content can be safely embedded in markup strings without triggering
style parsing.

### N6: Fix Segment.split_cells not handling zero-width characters

`Segment.split_cells()` in `segment.py` incorrectly counts zero-width
characters (ZWJ, combining marks) as occupying one cell, causing
misaligned output when splitting segments at a cell boundary. Fix the
cell measurement to use `cell_len()` for zero-width character detection.

### N7: Add Tree.sort_children() for alphabetical node ordering

The `Tree` class in `tree.py` stores children in insertion order via
`self.children: List[Tree]`, but there is no built-in way to sort child
nodes alphabetically or by a custom key. Add a `sort_children(key=None, reverse=False)` method that sorts the children list in place,
recursively sorting subtrees when `recursive=True` is passed.

### N8: Fix Panel title truncation not adding ellipsis

When a `Panel` title is longer than the panel width, the title is
hard-truncated without any visual indicator. Fix `Panel._render_title()`
to add an ellipsis (`…`) when the title must be truncated, preserving
one character of width for the ellipsis character.

### N9: Add IntPrompt with range validation to prompt module

The `prompt.py` module provides `IntPrompt` for integer input but does
not offer built-in numeric range validation — users must re-prompt
manually if the value is out of bounds. Add optional `min_value` and
`max_value` parameters to `IntPrompt` that validate the parsed integer
against the range and re-prompt with a message like
`"Please enter a value between 1 and 100"` when the constraint is
violated.

### N10: Add max_string_length parameter to Pretty for large string truncation

The `pretty.py` module's `Pretty` renderable and the `_traverse()`
function render all data structures in full, which can produce
megabytes of output for objects containing large strings (e.g., base64
blobs). Add a `max_string_length` parameter to the `Pretty` class and
the `pretty_repr()` / `_traverse()` functions that truncates string
values beyond the limit with an `"..."` suffix.

## Medium

### M1: Implement column-span support in Table

Add support for cells that span multiple columns in `Table`. Introduce a
`colspan` parameter on `Table.add_row()` that allows a cell to stretch
across adjacent columns. Requires changes to the column sizing algorithm
in `table.py`, the cell rendering loop to merge columns, and the border
drawing logic to omit internal column separators for spanned cells.

### M2: Add style inheritance for nested renderables

Implement style inheritance so that a `Panel` or `Group` can set a base
style that all child renderables inherit unless overridden. Requires
changes to `Console.render()` to pass an inherited style down the render
tree, updates to `Text` and other renderables to merge the inherited
style with their own, and changes to `Segment` to apply cascading styles.

### M3: Implement conditional markup tags based on terminal capabilities

Add conditional markup syntax `[on color_system>=256]...[/on]` that only
applies enclosed styles when the terminal supports the required color
depth. Requires extending the markup parser in `markup.py` to recognize
conditional tags, querying `Console.color_system` during rendering, and
updating the `Style` resolution to skip unsupported styles gracefully.

### M4: Add CSV and TSV export for Table

Implement `Table.export_csv()` and `Table.export_tsv()` methods that
output table data as comma- or tab-separated values, stripping all
styling. Requires extracting plain text from styled cells using
`Text.plain`, handling multi-line cells by joining with spaces, and
supporting header inclusion/exclusion. Add corresponding
`Console.save_csv()` convenience methods.

### M5: Implement collapsible sections in Tree

Add a `collapsed` parameter to `Tree.add()` that marks a subtree as
collapsed by default. When rendered, collapsed nodes show a `[+]`
indicator instead of their children. When used with `Live`, clicking
or pressing a key toggles expansion. Requires changes to `Tree`
rendering, guide character logic, and integration with `Live` for
interactive toggling. Also update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to document the interactive widget testing guidelines.

### M6: Add word-wrap mode to Text with hyphenation

Implement a `wrap_mode="word"` option for `Text` that wraps at word
boundaries instead of character boundaries. When a single word exceeds
the available width, apply simple hyphenation rules (break at syllable
boundaries using a basic algorithm). Requires changes to `Text.wrap()`,
the `Segment` splitting logic, and the `Console.render()` width
calculation.

### M7: Implement progress bar ETA smoothing with exponential moving average

Replace the current linear ETA estimation in `progress.py` with an
exponential moving average that smooths out speed fluctuations. Add a
`smoothing` parameter to `Progress` that controls the EMA weight.
Requires changes to `Task.speed`, the `TimeRemainingColumn`
calculation, and the `TransferSpeedColumn` display.

### M8: Add theme hot-reloading from TOML files

Implement `Theme.from_toml()` that loads styles from a TOML file and
`Console.load_theme()` that watches the file for changes and reloads
styles automatically. Requires a TOML parser integration in `theme.py`,
a file-watcher thread in `Console`, and re-rendering of active `Live`
displays when the theme changes.

### M9: Implement Segment-level caching for repeated renders

Add a render cache to `Console` that stores `Segment` output for
renderables that have not changed. Use a content-hash key so that
identical renderables hit the cache. Requires a cache store in
`Console`, a `__rich_hash__()` protocol method on renderables, and
cache invalidation when the console width changes.

### M10: Add accessibility attributes to Console output

Implement ANSI OSC sequences for screen reader accessibility: add a
`role` parameter to `Panel`, `Table`, and `Tree` that emits semantic
annotations. Add `Console.announce()` for screen reader announcements.
Requires changes to `Segment` to carry accessibility metadata, updates
to the `Console._render_buffer()` to emit OSC sequences, and additions
to `Panel`, `Table`, and `Tree` for role propagation.

## Wide

### W1: Implement a terminal UI widget system with focus management

Add an interactive widget system with `Input`, `Button`, `Select`, and
`Checkbox` widgets that render in a `Live` context and respond to
keyboard input. Implement focus management with tab-order navigation,
a `Form` container that groups widgets, and a submit action that returns
collected values. Changes span `live.py` for input handling, new widget
modules, `console.py` for raw-mode input, `segment.py` for cursor
positioning, and `style.py` for focus-state styles.

### W2: Add HTML export with faithful style reproduction

Implement `Console.save_html()` that renders console output as an HTML
page with CSS styles matching the terminal appearance. Support all
style attributes (colors, bold, italic, strikethrough, links),
preserve table layouts using CSS grid, render syntax highlighting
with Pygments CSS classes, and include a dark/light theme toggle.
Changes span `console.py` for the export entry point, a new
`html_export.py` module, `style.py` for CSS conversion, `table.py`
for grid layout, and `syntax.py` for CSS class integration.

### W3: Implement a dashboard layout system with auto-refreshing panels

Add a `Dashboard` class that arranges multiple `Live` renderables in a
grid layout computed from terminal dimensions. Each panel auto-refreshes
independently at configurable intervals. Support panel resizing on
terminal resize, panel-level titles and borders, and a status bar.
Changes span `layout.py` for grid computation, `live.py` for multi-
renderable refresh, `console.py` for terminal resize detection,
`panel.py` for titled containers, and `segment.py` for screen
buffer management.

### W4: Implement a theming and plugin system for custom renderables

Add a plugin architecture that allows third-party packages to register
custom renderables, styles, and markup tags via entry points. Implement
a `PluginManager` that discovers plugins, validates their interfaces,
resolves conflicts (duplicate tag names), and exposes them through the
`Console` API. Changes span `console.py` for plugin integration, a new
`plugins.py` module, `markup.py` for custom tag dispatch, `theme.py`
for plugin-provided styles, and `style.py` for extended attribute
registration.

### W5: Add internationalization support for all user-facing strings

Implement i18n across Rich's user-facing output. All error messages,
progress bar labels ("eta", "elapsed", "speed"), prompt defaults
("y/n"), column headers in `inspect()`, and traceback labels should be
translatable via gettext. Support locale detection from environment
variables and user-provided translation catalogs. Changes span
`progress.py`, `prompt.py`, `_inspect.py`, `traceback.py`,
`logging.py`, and a new `_locale.py` module.

### W6: Implement a test harness for renderable output verification

Add a testing framework `rich.testing` that captures rendered output
as `Segment` lists and provides assertion helpers: `assert_contains`,
`assert_style`, `assert_dimensions`, and snapshot testing for visual
regression. Include a pytest plugin with fixtures for `Console`
capture. Changes span a new `testing.py` module, a pytest plugin
module, `console.py` for capture mode, `segment.py` for segment
comparison, and `style.py` for style matching utilities.

### W7: Implement streaming log viewer with filtering and search

Add a `LogViewer` renderable that displays log records in a scrollable,
filterable live view. Support level-based coloring, regex search with
match highlighting, log source filtering, and timestamp formatting.
Implement a ring buffer for log storage and virtual scrolling for
performance. Changes span a new `log_viewer.py` module, `live.py` for
scroll input handling, `console.py` for raw-mode keyboard input,
`text.py` for search highlighting, `highlighter.py` for log-level
coloring, and `logging.py` for RichHandler integration.

### W8: Add automatic API documentation generation from Console recordings

Implement `Console.record()` mode that captures all output operations
as a replayable transcript, and `Console.export_docs()` that generates
Markdown or RST documentation from recordings. Support annotating
recordings with descriptions, grouping related outputs into sections,
and including code examples alongside rendered output. Changes span
`console.py` for recording, a new `docs_export.py` module, `text.py`
for plain-text extraction, `table.py` for Markdown table conversion,
`syntax.py` for code block formatting, and `markup.py` for markup-
to-Markdown translation.

### W9: Implement a diff viewer with side-by-side rendering

Add a `Diff` renderable that displays unified or side-by-side diffs
with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and inline change highlighting.
Support configurable context lines, word-level diff highlighting within
changed lines, and collapsible unchanged sections. Changes span a new
`diff.py` module, `syntax.py` for language-aware highlighting, `text.py`
for word-level diff marking, `table.py` for side-by-side layout,
`panel.py` for diff headers, and `console.py` for pager integration.

### W10: Implement a notification and toast system for terminal applications

Add a `Notifications` system that displays temporary messages (toasts)
overlaid on existing console output. Support priority levels (info,
warning, error), auto-dismiss timers, stacking of multiple notifications,
animation (slide-in/fade), and an action callback for interactive
toasts. Changes span a new `notifications.py` module, `live.py` for
overlay rendering, `console.py` for screen buffer compositing,
`segment.py` for z-order layering, `style.py` for notification-level
theming, and `layout.py` for overlay positioning.

### N11: Restructure `CHANGELOG.md` with categorized change sections

The `CHANGELOG.md` uses a flat list of changes per version without
categorization. Restructure the unreleased section to group entries
under Added, Changed, Fixed, and Deprecated headings following
Keep a Changelog format. Add hyperlinks to GitHub compare URLs for
each version heading so readers can see the full diff.

### M11: Revise `tox.ini` and `Makefile` to add documentation and benchmark targets

The `tox.ini` defines basic test environments but lacks dedicated
environments for documentation building and benchmark runs. Add a
`docs` environment that builds Sphinx documentation with warnings-as-
errors, a `bench` environment that runs `asv` benchmarks against the
current branch, and update the `Makefile` to add `make docs` and
`make bench` targets. Also update `.readthedocs.yml` to use the
new tox docs environment and update `.coveragerc` to exclude
benchmark files from coverage reports.

### W11: Comprehensive project configuration and documentation overhaul

Perform a full non-code refresh: update `pyproject.toml` metadata
with current classifiers, project URLs, and PEP 639 license
declarations. Revise `CONTRIBUTING.md` to add sections on Rich
renderable development guidelines and visual regression testing.
Restructure `CHANGELOG.md` to follow Keep a Changelog format across
all versions. Update `tox.ini` to add type-checking and linting
environments. Revise the `Makefile` with consolidated targets.
Update `.coveragerc` to add branch coverage and exclusion patterns.
Update `.pre-commit-config.yaml` hook versions and add `ruff`
formatting hooks.
