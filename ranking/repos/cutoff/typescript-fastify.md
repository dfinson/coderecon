## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Add response time header to Reply prototype

The `Reply` prototype in `reply.js` tracks the start time of request
handling but does not automatically include the elapsed time in the
response. Add a configurable `X-Response-Time` header that is set in
`Reply.prototype.send()` by computing the difference between
`process.hrtime()` at request start (stored during route handler
dispatch in `handle-request.js`) and the send time.

### N2: Fix Reply.prototype.header not validating header name format

The `Reply.prototype.header()` method in `reply.js` sets response
headers without validating the header name against RFC 7230 token
rules. Passing header names with spaces, colons, or control characters
succeeds silently and can produce malformed HTTP responses. Add
validation to `header()` that throws `FST_ERR_REP_INVALID_HEADER_NAME`
(defined in `errors.js`) for non-compliant header names.

### N3: Add body size tracking to content-type parser

The `rawBody()` function in `content-type-parser.js` reads the request
body in chunks but does not track the total bytes received for logging
or metrics purposes. Add a `request.bodySize` property that is set
after body parsing completes, reflecting the actual uncompressed byte
count, and expose it through the `Request` object in `request.js`.

### N4: Fix error-handler not preserving original error stack trace

The `handleError()` function in `error-handler.js` wraps non-Error
thrown values into proper Error objects, but when a user error handler
itself throws, the original error's stack trace is lost in favor of
the wrapper. Preserve the original error as a `cause` property (using
ES2022 Error cause) on the wrapper error in `fallbackErrorHandler()`.

### N5: Add wildcard content-type parser removal

The `ContentTypeParser.prototype.remove()` method in
`content-type-parser.js` removes parsers by exact content-type string,
but provides no way to remove all parsers matching a pattern (e.g.,
all `application/*` parsers). Add an optional glob-style matching mode
to `remove()` that removes all registered parsers whose content-type
matches the pattern.

### N6: Fix head-route not copying schema from GET route

The `generateHeadRoute()` function in `head-route.js` creates automatic
HEAD routes for GET routes, but does not copy the `schema` property
from the original GET route options. This means HEAD routes lack
validation schemas, causing inconsistent behavior when schema-based
plugins are used. Copy the `schema` (excluding `body` and `response`)
from the GET route to the generated HEAD route.

### N7: Add request ID format validation to req-id-gen-factory

The `reqIdGenFactory()` in `req-id-gen-factory.js` creates request ID
generators but does not validate that custom `genReqId` functions
return values that are safe for use in headers and logs. A generator
returning objects, undefined, or strings with newlines can cause
malformed headers. Add runtime validation in `routeHandler()` in
`route.js` that checks the generated ID is a string or number.

### N8: Fix plugin-utils not detecting circular plugin dependencies

The plugin utility functions in `plugin-utils.js` handle plugin
metadata but do not detect circular dependencies when plugins depend
on decorators provided by each other. When two plugins each `dependsOn`
the other, the server hangs during boot. Add cycle detection in the
dependency resolution path and throw `FST_ERR_PLUGIN_CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY`
with the cycle path listed.

### N9: Add schema compilation caching metrics to schema-controller

The `SchemaController` in `schema-controller.js` compiles JSON schemas
for validation and serialization but provides no visibility into
compilation performance. Add a `getCompilationStats()` method that
returns the number of compiled schemas, cache hit/miss counts, and
total compilation time, useful for diagnosing slow startup in
applications with many routes.

### N10: Fix noop-set missing Symbol.iterator implementation

The `NoopSet` class in `noop-set.js` is used as a disabled-feature
placeholder but does not implement `Symbol.iterator`, causing
`for...of` loops over the set to throw `TypeError`. Add a
`[Symbol.iterator]()` method that returns an empty iterator, matching
the native `Set` interface contract.

## Medium

### M1: Implement route versioning with content negotiation

Add route versioning support that allows registering multiple handlers
for the same path with different versions, selected via `Accept-Version`
header or URL prefix. Requires a version constraint strategy in
`route.js`, integration with `find-my-way` router's constraint system,
version extraction in `handle-request.js`, and TypeScript definitions
in `types/route.d.ts` for version configuration.

### M2: Add response compression with content-type awareness

Implement built-in response compression in the `Reply` prototype. Add
a `reply.compress()` method and a global `compression` option that
automatically compresses responses based on `Accept-Encoding` and
content-type. Support gzip, deflate, and Brotli. Integrate with
`Reply.prototype.send()` for automatic compression, the serialization
pipeline for content-length recalculation, and the TypeScript definitions
in `types/reply.d.ts`.

### M3: Implement request body validation error customization

The validation pipeline in `validation.js` generates error responses
from schema validation failures, but the error format is fixed. Add
a `validationErrorFormatter` option that transforms validation errors
into custom response shapes. Integrate with `compileSchemasForValidation()`
for error formatting, `Reply.prototype.send()` for error serialization,
the error handler in `error-handler.js` for fallback formatting, and
update `types/route.d.ts` for the formatter type.

### M4: Add graceful shutdown with in-flight request tracking

Implement graceful shutdown that tracks in-flight requests and waits
for them to complete before closing the server. Add a
`fastify.activeRequests` counter incremented in `routeHandler()` in
`route.js` and decremented after `Reply.prototype.send()`. Add a
`fastify.close({ timeout: 30000 })` option in `server.js` that stops
accepting new connections and resolves when all in-flight requests
complete or the timeout expires. Update the hook system in `hooks.js`
to fire `onShutdown` hooks.

### M5: Implement decorator inheritance control for plugins

The decorator system in `decorate.js` always inherits decorators from
parent contexts to child plugin contexts via `plugin-override.js`.
Add an `isolate` option to `fastify.register()` that prevents decorator
inheritance, giving plugins a clean namespace. Requires changes to
`plugin-override.js` for isolation logic, `decorate.js` for the
isolation check, `route.js` for context resolution with isolated
plugins, and `types/register.d.ts` for the option type.

### M6: Add structured error codes to all internal errors

The `errors.js` module defines some error codes (e.g.,
`FST_ERR_CTP_ALREADY_PRESENT`) but several internal throw sites in
`route.js`, `reply.js`, and `hooks.js` throw plain `Error` objects
without codes. Audit all throw sites, define error codes in `errors.js`
for each, replace plain `Error` throws with coded errors, and update
`types/errors.d.ts` with the new error code types.

### M7: Implement request context propagation across async hooks

The hook system in `hooks.js` runs hooks sequentially but does not
propagate context (e.g., tracing IDs, user data) set by early hooks
to later hooks or the route handler without using request decoration.
Add a `request.context` map that is initialized before `onRequest`
hooks and flows through `preParsing`, `preValidation`, `preHandler`,
and `preSerialization` hooks. Integrate with `handle-request.js` for
context initialization and `request.js` for the context property.

### M8: Add route-level timeout configuration

The timeout handling in `route.js` (`handleTimeout()`) uses a global
`connectionTimeout` but does not support per-route timeouts. Add a
`timeout` option to route definitions that overrides the global
timeout for specific routes. Integrate with `routeHandler()` for
per-route timer setup, `Reply.prototype.send()` for timer cleanup,
the 408 response generation in `handle-request.js`, and
`types/route.d.ts` for the option type.

### M9: Implement response schema validation in development mode

The serialization pipeline in `validation.js` compiles response schemas
for serialization but does not validate outgoing responses against
those schemas. Add a `validateResponse` option (enabled by default in
development) that validates the response body against the declared
response schema before serialization. Log warnings for schema
violations. Integrate with `Reply.prototype.serialize()` in `reply.js`,
the schema controller in `schema-controller.js`, and the logger
in `logger-factory.js`.

### M10: Add support for async content-type parsers with backpressure

The `rawBody()` function in `content-type-parser.js` buffers the entire
request body in memory before calling the parser. Add streaming parser
support where parsers receive a `Readable` stream instead of a
`Buffer`. Implement backpressure handling so slow parsers pause the
incoming stream. Integrate with `ContentTypeParser.prototype.add()` for
parser registration, `ContentTypeParser.prototype.run()` for parser
selection, and `handle-request.js` for stream piping.

### W1: Implement a rate limiting system with pluggable stores

Add built-in rate limiting with configurable strategies (fixed window,
sliding window, token bucket). Support pluggable stores (in-memory,
Redis, custom) for distributed rate limiting. Include per-route and
global rate limit configuration, rate limit headers
(`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`),
and custom key extraction (IP, user ID, API key). Changes span a new
`lib/rate-limit.js` module, `route.js` for per-route config,
`hooks.js` for `onRequest` hook integration, `reply.js` for header
injection, `errors.js` for rate limit error codes, and
`types/instance.d.ts` for configuration types.

### W2: Add OpenAPI specification generation from route schemas

Implement automatic OpenAPI 3.0 document generation from registered
routes. Extract path parameters, query schemas, request body schemas,
and response schemas from route definitions. Support security scheme

`lib/openapi.js` module, `route.js` for schema metadata extraction,
`context.js` for route metadata storage, `schemas.js` for `$ref`
resolution into OpenAPI format, `reply.js` for spec serving, and
`types/instance.d.ts` for OpenAPI configuration types.

### W3: Implement server-sent events (SSE) support

Add first-class SSE support with a `reply.sse()` method that opens a
persistent connection and returns an event emitter. Support named
events, retry intervals, last-event-ID resumption, and automatic
client reconnection detection. Implement connection keep-alive via
periodic comment pings. Changes span `reply.js` for the `sse()` method
and connection lifecycle, a new `lib/sse.js` module for event
formatting and connection management, `hooks.js` for `onClose` hook
integration, `route.js` for SSE route registration, `handle-request.js`
for SSE-aware timeout handling, and `types/reply.d.ts` for SSE types.

### W4: Add request/response transformation pipeline

Implement a transformation pipeline that allows registering ordered
transformers for requests and responses. Transformers can modify
headers, body, and URL before/after the handler. Support conditional
transformers based on content-type, route, or custom predicates.
Include built-in transformers for header normalization, body
encryption/decryption, and response envelope wrapping. Changes span
a new `lib/transform.js` module, `hooks.js` for transformer execution
in `preParsing` and `preSerialization`, `reply.js` for response
transformation, `route.js` for per-route transformer config,
`plugin-override.js` for transformer inheritance, and `types/hooks.d.ts`
for transformer types.

### W5: Implement distributed tracing with W3C Trace Context

Add distributed tracing support following W3C Trace Context (RFC
traceparent/tracestate). Generate trace and span IDs, propagate
context through headers, create spans for request lifecycle phases
(parsing, validation, handler, serialization), and expose a tracer
API on the fastify instance. Support export to console, Jaeger, and
custom backends. Changes span a new `lib/tracing.js` module,
`handle-request.js` for span lifecycle, `hooks.js` for trace hook
integration, `reply.js` for response header injection, `request.js`
for trace context parsing, `logger-factory.js` for trace-aware
logging, and `types/instance.d.ts` for tracer types.

### W6: Add WebSocket support with route-level handlers

Implement WebSocket support that integrates with the route system.
Add `fastify.ws(path, handler)` for WebSocket route registration,
protocol upgrade handling in the server module, per-connection
lifecycle hooks (`onConnection`, `onMessage`, `onClose`, `onError`),
and authentication via `onRequest` hooks. Support broadcasting and
room-based messaging. Changes span `server.js` for upgrade handling,
a new `lib/websocket.js` module for connection management, `route.js`
for WebSocket route registration, `hooks.js` for WebSocket lifecycle
hooks, `reply.js` for upgrade response, `errors.js` for WebSocket
error codes, and `types/instance.d.ts` for WebSocket types.

### W7: Implement configuration-driven route loading

Add a declarative route loading system that reads route definitions
from JSON/YAML configuration files and registers them with the
Fastify instance. Support path patterns, HTTP methods, handler
references (module paths), schema definitions, hook assignments,
and plugin scoping. Include hot-reload support in development mode.
Changes span a new `lib/config-routes.js` module (config parser and
route builder), `route.js` for programmatic registration, `hooks.js`
for config-defined hooks, `validation.js` for schema loading from
files, `plugin-override.js` for plugin-scoped config routes, and
type definitions in `types/instance.d.ts`.

### W8: Add response caching with cache-control awareness

Implement a response caching system that respects `Cache-Control`
headers. Cache responses in memory or pluggable stores, support
cache key generation from method/URL/query/vary headers, implement
stale-while-revalidate and stale-if-error strategies, and add cache
status headers (`X-Cache: HIT/MISS/STALE`). Changes span a new
`lib/cache.js` module (cache store, key generation, revalidation),
`hooks.js` for `onRequest` cache lookup and `onSend` cache storage,
`reply.js` for cache header injection, `route.js` for per-route
cache configuration, `handle-request.js` for cache-aware request
flow, and `types/route.d.ts` for cache option types.

### W9: Implement health check endpoints with dependency monitoring

Add a comprehensive health check system with `/health`, `/ready`, and
`/live` endpoints. Support dependency health checks (database, cache,
external services) with configurable timeouts and retry logic. Include
aggregated health status with per-dependency detail, startup probe
support, and health check result caching. Changes span a new
`lib/health.js` module (health checker, dependency registry),
`route.js` for health route registration, `hooks.js` for startup
readiness hooks, `server.js` for server state tracking, `errors.js`
for health check error codes, `reply.js` for health response
formatting, and `types/instance.d.ts` for health check types.

### W10: Add multi-tenant routing with tenant isolation

Implement multi-tenant support where routes, plugins, and decorators
can be scoped to specific tenants. Add tenant extraction from headers,
subdomains, or path prefixes. Support tenant-specific configuration,
per-tenant error handlers, and tenant-aware logging. Implement tenant
isolation so plugins registered for one tenant are invisible to others.
Changes span a new `lib/tenant.js` module (tenant extraction and
context), `route.js` for tenant-scoped routes, `plugin-override.js`
for tenant-isolated plugin contexts, `hooks.js` for tenant lifecycle
hooks, `decorate.js` for tenant-scoped decorators, `error-handler.js`
for tenant error handlers, and `types/instance.d.ts` for tenant types.

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in .borp.yaml

The project configuration file `.borp.yaml` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in .borp.yaml, and update SPONSORS.md to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `docs/Reference/Principles.md`, `.github/labeler.yml`, `.borp.yaml`, `package.json`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
