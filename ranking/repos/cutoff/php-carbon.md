## Why this repo

- **Well-structured**: Core classes (`Carbon`, `CarbonImmutable`,
  `CarbonInterval`, `CarbonPeriod`) compose behaviour from fine-grained
  traits in `Traits/` — `Creator`, `Difference`, `Comparison`,
  `Converter`, `Modifiers`, `Localization`, `Units`, `Boundaries`,
  `Serialization`, and more. The interface `CarbonInterface` defines
  the comprehensive API contract.
- **Rich history**: 5K+ commits, 17K+ stars. The standard PHP date/time
  library, extending PHP's `DateTime`. Issues cover timezone edge cases,
  DST transitions, locale formatting, and interval arithmetic.
- **Permissive**: MIT license.

## Tasks

30 tasks (10 narrow, 10 medium, 10 wide).

## Narrow

### N1: Fix diffForHumans not handling micro-second precision for sub-second diffs

The `diffForHumans()` method in `Traits/Difference.php` reports diffs
down to seconds but does not include microsecond-level precision. When
two Carbon instances differ by less than one second, the output is
"0 seconds ago" rather than a microsecond-accurate representation. Add
a `microsecond` resolution option so `diffForHumans()` can report
"500 milliseconds ago" or "250 microseconds ago" when configured.

### N2: Add `toRelativeCalendarString()` for colloquial date references

The `Converter` trait in `Traits/Converter.php` provides various
`toString` formats but lacks a relative calendar method that returns
"today", "yesterday", "tomorrow", "last Monday", or "next Friday"
depending on the date relative to now. Add `toRelativeCalendarString()`
using the existing locale translations from `Lang/` for the day and
relative terms.

### N3: Fix CarbonPeriod iteration skipping dates at DST boundaries

The `CarbonPeriod` class in `CarbonPeriod.php` iterates by adding
intervals to a start date. When crossing a DST boundary with a 1-hour
interval, the iteration can skip or double-count the ambiguous hour.
Fix the iteration logic to use wall-clock arithmetic that preserves the
intended step size across DST transitions, using `CarbonTimeZone`
offset detection.

### N4: Add `closestWeekday()` modifier to Modifiers trait

The `Modifiers` trait in `Traits/Modifiers.php` provides `nextWeekday()`
and `previousWeekday()` but not a `closestWeekday()` that returns the
nearest weekday (Mon–Fri), preferring the same day if it is already a
weekday. Add `closestWeekday()` that returns Saturday→Friday and
Sunday→Monday, using the existing `isWeekday()` check in the
`Comparison` trait.

### N5: Fix `startOfQuarter()` not respecting custom fiscal year start month

The `Boundaries` trait in `Traits/Boundaries.php` calculates quarters
based on calendar months (Q1 = Jan–Mar). When a fiscal year starts in
a non-January month (e.g., April for UK financial year), `startOfQuarter()`
returns incorrect boundaries. Add a `fiscalYearStartMonth` option to
`Options` trait and use it in the quarter boundary calculations.

### N6: Add `diffInBusinessDays()` to Difference trait

The `Difference` trait in `Traits/Difference.php` provides `diffInDays()`,
`diffInWeekdays()`, and similar methods but not a business-day diff
that excludes weekends and configurable public holidays. Add
`diffInBusinessDays()` that accepts an optional array of holiday dates
and counts only Mon–Fri non-holiday days between two dates.

### N7: Fix `createFromTimestamp()` losing microsecond precision on 32-bit systems

The `Creator` trait in `Traits/Creator.php` implements
`createFromTimestamp()` using integer casting for the timestamp. On
32-bit systems, float timestamps lose microsecond precision due to
floating-point representation. Fix the method to use string-based
timestamp parsing via `createFromFormat('U.u', ...)` to preserve
microsecond accuracy regardless of platform.

### N8: Add `toHumanDuration()` for CarbonInterval

The `CarbonInterval` class in `CarbonInterval.php` can be cast to
strings but lacks a human-friendly duration formatter that respects the
current locale. Add `toHumanDuration()` that formats intervals like
"2 hours, 30 minutes" (English) or "2 heures, 30 minutes" (French),
using the translation files in `Lang/` and the `Localization` trait.

### N9: Fix `isSameAs()` format comparison not handling timezone-aware formats

The `isSameAs()` method in `Traits/Comparison.php` compares two dates
by formatting both with a given format string (e.g., `'Y-m-d'`). When
the format includes timezone-sensitive components (e.g., `'H'` for
hour), two dates in different timezones can incorrectly compare as
different even when they represent the same instant. Fix `isSameAs()`
to normalise both dates to the same timezone before formatting when
the format includes time components.

### N10: Add `age()` method returning years, months, and days decomposition

The `Difference` trait in `Traits/Difference.php` provides `age` as an
integer number of years, but there is no method that returns a full
decomposition (years, months, days) suitable for displaying a person's
exact age. Add `exactAge()` returning a `CarbonInterval` with precise
year/month/day components, handling leap years correctly.

## Medium

### M1: Implement recurring schedule support in CarbonPeriod

Extend `CarbonPeriod` to support recurring schedules: "every Tuesday
and Thursday from 9:00 to 17:00" or "first Monday of every month".
Add a `schedule()` factory that accepts a cron-like expression or a
fluent DSL, iteration logic in `CarbonPeriod`, conflict detection for
overlapping schedules, and `Comparison` traits for testing schedule
membership.

### M2: Add timezone-aware range operations to Comparison trait

Implement `overlaps()`, `contains()`, `gap()`, and `intersection()`
for date ranges represented as pairs of Carbon instances. Handle
timezone differences by normalising to UTC internally. Support
open-ended ranges (null start/end). Requires new methods in
`Traits/Comparison.php`, helper types for range representation, and
integration with `CarbonPeriod` for iteration over intersections.

### M3: Implement a date expression parser for natural language input

Add `Carbon::parseNaturalLanguage('next business day after Christmas')`,
supporting relative expressions ("3 weeks from now"), named dates
("Christmas", "Easter"), ordinal references ("third Friday in November"),
and combinations. Requires a tokeniser and recursive-descent parser in a
new `Parser/` namespace, integration with `Creator` trait's `parse()`
method, and locale-aware date name resolution via `Localization`.

### M4: Add calendar system abstraction for non-Gregorian calendars

Implement support for Jalali (Persian), Hijri (Islamic), and Hebrew
calendars via a `CalendarSystem` abstraction. Add `toJalali()`,
`toHijri()`, and `fromJalali()` conversion methods. Requires a calendar
converter interface, conversion algorithms in a new `Calendar/`
namespace, integration with the `Converter` and `Creator` traits, and
locale-specific month/day names in `Lang/`.

### M5: Implement a date testing DSL with fluent assertions

Add `Carbon::assertThat($date)->isWeekday()->isAfter('2024-01-01')
->hasTimezone('UTC')` for expressive test assertions. Support
negation (`isNot()`), chaining, custom failure messages, and
integration with PHPUnit custom assertions. Requires a new
`Testing/DateAssert` class, method delegation to `Comparison` trait
methods, PHPUnit assertion integration, and a `Traits/Test.php`
extension.

### M6: Add work-schedule-aware date arithmetic

Implement `addBusinessDays(5)`, `subBusinessHours(3)`, and
`nextBusinessHour()` that respect configurable work schedules (e.g.,
Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00) and holiday calendars. Requires a `Schedule`
configuration class, modifications to `Traits/Modifiers.php` and
`Traits/Units.php` for schedule-aware arithmetic, holiday storage, and
integration with `Factory` for per-instance schedule binding.

### M7: Implement a lightweight cron expression parser for CarbonPeriod

Add `CarbonPeriod::fromCron('0 9 * * MON-FRI')` that generates dates
matching a cron schedule. Support standard 5-field cron and extensions
(seconds, years). Requires a cron parser in a new `Cron/` namespace,
integration with `CarbonPeriod` for iteration, timezone handling for
cron evaluation, and `Comparison` trait support for `matchesCron()`.

### M8: Add ISO 8601 duration and interval serialisation round-tripping

The `Serialization` trait in `Traits/Serialization.php` handles JSON
serialisation but does not fully round-trip ISO 8601 duration strings
(e.g., `P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S`) through `CarbonInterval`. Fix parsing of
the full ISO 8601 duration spec including weeks, fractional values,
and negative durations. Add `toISO8601Duration()` and ensure
`CarbonInterval::fromString()` handles all valid ISO formats.

### M9: Implement relative date formatting with granularity control

Extend `diffForHumans()` in `Traits/Difference.php` to support
multi-unit output: "2 years, 3 months ago" instead of "2 years ago".
Add a `parts` option to control the number of units shown, a
`threshold` option for when to roll up to the next unit, and
`join` and `separator` options for output formatting. Propagate
locale-specific conjunctions from `Lang/`.

### M10: Add clock abstraction with PSR-20 compliance across all factories

The `WrapperClock` class provides basic PSR-20 support, but the
`Factory` and `FactoryImmutable` classes do not consistently use it
for all time-dependent operations. Refactor all `now()` calls,
`setTestNow()`, and timestamp generation in `Creator`, `Comparison`,
and `Difference` traits to delegate to a configurable `ClockInterface`,
enabling dependency-injected time in testing without global state.

## Wide

### W1: Implement a comprehensive date/time validation framework

Add `Carbon::validate('2024-02-30', 'Y-m-d')` with rich validation:
date existence checking (Feb 30 doesn't exist), format strictness,
range constraints, timezone validity, and business rule validation
(e.g., "must be a business day"). Return structured validation results
with error codes. Changes span `Creator` parsing, a new `Validation/`
namespace, format analysis, timezone validation in `CarbonTimeZone`,
and locale-aware error messages.

### W2: Add event sourcing support with immutable date timeline

Implement a `Timeline` class that tracks date/time state changes as an
immutable event log: "created at X, modified at Y, timezone changed to
Z". Support replaying timelines to reconstruct state, diffing timelines,
serialisation, and undo/redo. Changes span `CarbonImmutable`, a new
`Timeline/` namespace, `Serialization` trait, `Factory`, and integration
with `CarbonPeriod` for timeline queries.

### W3: Implement a timezone intelligence layer

Add timezone-aware features beyond basic conversion: business-hours
overlap detection between timezones, optimal meeting time finder across
multiple timezones, timezone abbreviation disambiguation (CST = Central
vs. China), DST transition prediction, and timezone change history.
Changes span `CarbonTimeZone`, `Comparison` trait, a new `Timezone/`
namespace, IANA timezone database parsing, and `Localization` for
timezone name translations.

### W4: Add comprehensive date arithmetic with overflow strategies

Implement configurable overflow strategies for all date arithmetic:
`addMonths(1)` on Jan 31 could overflow to Mar 3 (current default),
clamp to Feb 28/29, or throw. Support per-operation strategy override,
global defaults in `Options`, and strategy composition for chained
operations. Changes span `Traits/Units.php`, `Traits/Modifiers.php`,
`Traits/Options.php`, `CarbonInterval`, `CarbonPeriod`, and
`Factory` configuration.

### W5: Implement a date formatting template engine

Add `Carbon::format('{relative} ({iso})')` with template syntax
supporting conditionals (`{if:past}ago{/if}`), pluralisation
(`{count:year|years}`), locale switching (`{locale:fr}{month}{/locale}`),
and nested expressions. Requires a template parser, an expression
evaluator, integration with `Converter` trait methods, `Localization`
for locale switching, and a template cache for performance.

### W6: Add a migration toolkit for DateTime to Carbon conversion

Implement static analysis tools and runtime helpers for migrating
legacy code from `DateTime` to `Carbon`: a PHP-CS-Fixer rule for
automated conversion, runtime deprecation notices for `DateTime` usage,
a compatibility layer that logs Carbon-specific methods called on
plain `DateTime` objects, and migration guides. Changes span `Cast`
trait, a new `Migration/` namespace, `Factory`, `PHPStan/` extensions,
and Laravel integration.

### W7: Implement a calendar UI data provider

Add `Carbon::calendarMonth(2024, 3)` that returns structured data for
rendering calendar UIs: weeks with day cells including day number,
events, today marker, selection state, and disabled status. Support
month/week/day/agenda views, locale-aware week starts, and event
overlay from a configurable event source. Changes span `Boundaries`
trait, `Week` trait, a new `Calendar/` namespace, `CarbonPeriod` for
date generation, and `Localization` for day/month names.

### W8: Add duration parsing and formatting for human-readable intervals

Implement bidirectional parsing between human strings ("2h 30m",
"1 day, 3 hours", "1.5 weeks") and `CarbonInterval`. Support multiple
input formats (colon-notation "2:30:00", abbreviated "2h30m", verbose
"two hours and thirty minutes"), locale-aware parsing, and ambiguity
resolution. Changes span `CarbonInterval`, a new `Duration/` parser
namespace, `Localization` for unit names, `Creator` trait integration,
and `Converter` trait for output formatting.

### W9: Implement date-aware data structure utilities

Add `CarbonCollection` — a sorted, timezone-aware collection of Carbon
instances with methods: `groupByDay()`, `gaps()`, `overlaps()`,
`clusterByProximity()`, `histogram()`, and `statistics()` (mean, median,
mode date). Support lazy evaluation and streaming. Changes span a new
`Collection/` namespace, `Comparison` trait for sorting, `Difference`
trait for clustering, `CarbonPeriod` integration, and `Serialization`
for collection export.

### W10: Add comprehensive audit logging for date manipulation

Implement `Carbon::withAudit()` that wraps a Carbon instance with an
audit trail recording every mutation: method called, arguments, result,
timestamp, calling code location. Support serialisation of audit logs,
diff-based change reports, and integration with logging frameworks.
Changes span a new `Audit/` namespace, proxy generation for
`CarbonInterface` methods, `Traits/Modifiers.php` instrumentation,
`Traits/Units.php`, `Serialization`, and `Factory` wiring.

## Non-code focused

### N11: Fix outdated or inconsistent metadata in phpmd.xml

The project configuration file `phpmd.xml` contains metadata that has
drifted from the actual project state. Audit the file for incorrect
version constraints, outdated URLs, deprecated configuration keys,
or missing entries that should be present based on the current
codebase structure. Fix the inconsistencies.

### M11: Add or improve CI workflow and update related documentation

The CI configuration needs improvement: add a workflow step for
linting or type-checking that currently only runs locally, ensure
the CI matrix covers all supported platform/version combinations
listed in phpmd.xml, and update .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md to document the CI
process and badge status for contributors.

### W11: Overhaul project configuration, CI, and documentation consistency

Multiple non-code files have drifted from each other and from the
actual project state. Specifically: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `phpmd.xml`, `tests/phpmd-test.xml`
need to be audited and synchronized. Version requirements in config
files should match CI matrix entries, documentation should reflect
current APIs and configuration options, and build/CI files should
use consistent tooling versions. Fix all inconsistencies across
these files to ensure a coherent project configuration.
