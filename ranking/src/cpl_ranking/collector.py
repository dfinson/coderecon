"""Data collection orchestrator — ground truth phase.

Drives the stable, run-once portion of §5.3:
  Phase 1: Solve — coding agent solves task (SOLVE_PROMPT)
  Phase 2: Reflect — agent produces ground truth (REFLECT_PROMPT)

Output per task: one Run + N TouchedObjects + 3-6 Queries, written as
JSONL to data/{repo_id}/ground_truth/.

The retrieval signal collection (recon_raw_signals) is a separate step
in ``collect_signals.py`` — it depends on the current state of
codeplane's harvesters and will be re-collected as we iterate.

Prompts are defined in ``prompts.py``.
See §5 of ranking-design.md.

    Phase 1 (Solve):

      3. Capture git diff → map changed lines to DefFacts via codeplane

    Phase 2 (Reflect):

         - read_necessary: file paths read that were needed
         - queries: 3 OK (L0/L1/L2) + up to 3 non-OK
