# Role: Task Executor

You are the **task executor**. Your job is to solve each task in the
tasks file, capture your work, and produce structured ground truth
records that will train a code retrieval model.

## Inputs

You will be given:
1. A path to a **tasks markdown file** describing the repo and 30 tasks
2. Access to the **cloned repository** you are currently working inside

Read the tasks file thoroughly before starting. Understand the repo
structure, scale, and domain before solving any task.

## Your job

Work through every task sequentially (N1–N10, M1–M10, W1–W10).

For EACH task:

---

### STEP 1 — SOLVE

Read the code, make edits, and verify they work. Capture a `git diff`.

**While solving, track your exploration process mentally.** Pay
attention to:
- What you searched for first and why
- What you read to understand the problem space
- Dead ends — code you explored that turned out irrelevant
- Key decisions — when you had multiple approaches, which you chose
- The moment the solution clicked and what context triggered it
- What you'd search for differently with hindsight

After capturing the diff: `git stash` to restore clean state before
the next task.

---

### STEP 2 — REFLECT

Write a JSON file to `../../data/{repo_id}/ground_truth/{task_id}.json`.

> **{repo_id}** is the markdown filename without `.md` (e.g.,
> `python-fastapi` from `python-fastapi.md`).

#### Ground truth JSON format

#### Field definitions

**task_id:** The heading ID from the md file (N1, M1, W2, etc.)

**task_text:** The full task description text, verbatim.

**diff:** The raw `git diff` output from your solution.

**solve_notes:** 1–3 sentences explaining what you did and why.

**exploration_log:** A structured record of how you explored the
codebase while solving this task. This data trains us to understand
agent navigation patterns. Be honest — include wrong turns.

- `search_sequence`: ordered list of searches/reads you performed
- `dead_ends`: code you investigated that didn't contribute
- `key_decisions`: choices between approaches with reasoning
- `aha_moment`: the insight or piece of context that made the solution
  click
- `hindsight`: what you'd do differently knowing the answer

**confidence:** Your confidence in ground truth completeness.
- `"high"` = certain nothing is missing or extra
- `"medium"` = mostly confident but one or two defs might be wrong
- `"low"` = unsure, task was complex with many dependencies

**minimum_sufficient_defs:** The minimum set of defs a COMPETENT HUMAN
DEVELOPER would need to see to implement the correct solution. If you
removed any def from this list, a skilled developer could not complete
the task correctly without finding it themselves. Includes:
- Every def you EDITED (reason starts with `"edited:"`)
- Every def you absolutely HAD to read for correctness (contracts,
  interfaces, type signatures you relied on)

**thrash_preventing_defs:** ADDITIONAL defs (beyond minimum_sufficient)
that an AI CODING AGENT would need to see upfront to avoid making
unnecessary search/read calls during implementation. These are defs
where:
- Not seeing them would cause the agent to make wrong assumptions
  and then backtrack
- The agent would proactively search for them out of caution
- Understanding them prevents a wrong turn even if a human wouldn't
  need to check

Think: *"What context would I need upfront so I could implement the
solution WITHOUT making any additional search or read calls?"* The
union of minimum_sufficient + thrash_preventing is that set.

**tier_difference_reasoning:** Explain concretely why the two tiers
differ. Name the specific defs in thrash_preventing and say why an AI
agent would search for them. If thrash_preventing is empty, explain
why the minimum set already covers everything an agent needs.

**excluded_defs:** Defs you opened during solving but consciously
excluded from both lists. Include the reason. This lets an auditor
verify you considered and rejected them (not that you forgot them).

Do NOT include in any list:
- Defs you opened and immediately closed without using
- Defs you skimmed out of curiosity but didn't need
- Entire files — list specific defs

Each entry has:
- `path`: repo-relative file path (e.g., `"src/auth/middleware.py"`)
- `name`: the definition's simple name (e.g., `"check_rate"`)
- `kind`: one of: `function`, `method`, `class`, `struct`, `interface`,
  `trait`, `enum`, `variable`, `constant`, `module`, `property`, `pair`,
  `key`, `table`, `target`, `heading`
- `reason`: why this def is in this category

If you edited a method inside a class, list the METHOD. Only list the
parent class if you also needed its class-level code.

**WHY THIS MATTERS:** `minimum_sufficient_defs` becomes the recall
floor — if the model misses any of these, that's a hard failure.
`thrash_preventing_defs` becomes the training target — the model learns
to return this larger set to prevent agent thrash. If you include junk,
the model learns to surface junk. If you miss something, the model
learns to miss it. Be precise.

---

#### Seed and pin rules

- **seeds:** symbol names from the code you touched. Pick the 1–4 MOST
  CENTRAL ones — what a developer would know from the task description
  or from browsing the repo structure before starting work. Do NOT
  include every helper that got touched.
- **pins:** repo-relative file paths. Pick the 2–4 MOST OBVIOUS files
  — what a developer could identify from the task description or repo
  structure before starting work.
- Seeds and pins represent what a developer knows GOING IN, not perfect
  hindsight of the full answer.

#### The 8 OK query types (ALL 8 REQUIRED per task)

**Q_SEMANTIC** (isolation — embedding only):
Describe the problem using ONLY domain/business concepts.
FORBIDDEN: symbol names, file paths, code terms, language keywords.
REQUIRED: a description that a non-programmer could understand.
seeds: `[]`  pins: `[]`

**Q_LEXICAL** (isolation — full-text only):
Use strings that appear LITERALLY in the source code.
REQUIRED: at least one phrase in quotes that grep would find — an error
message, log string, comment, docstring, or string literal.
FORBIDDEN: symbol names that don't appear as literal strings.
seeds: `[]`  pins: `[]`

**Q_IDENTIFIER** (isolation — term match only):
List exact symbol names from the code you touched.
REQUIRED: at least 3 symbol names, comma-separated.
FORBIDDEN: file paths, English descriptions, relationship words.
seeds: `[]`  pins: `[]`

**Q_STRUCTURAL** (isolation — graph only):
Describe the code through structural relationships.
REQUIRED: at least one concrete symbol AND a relationship word
(callers, callees, subclasses, implementors, siblings, imports).
seeds: 1–2 (the entry points for graph traversal)  pins: `[]`

**Q_NAVIGATIONAL** (isolation — explicit/path only):
Use explicit file paths and directory locations.
REQUIRED: at least 2 file paths from the files you touched.
FORBIDDEN: domain descriptions, relationship words.
seeds: `[]`  pins: 2–4 file paths from your solution

**Q_SEM_IDENT** (combination — embedding + term match):
Domain description that also names key symbols naturally.
REQUIRED: mix domain concepts with 2–3 exact symbol names.
seeds: 2–3 of the symbols mentioned  pins: `[]`

**Q_IDENT_NAV** (combination — term match + explicit):
Symbol names with file paths.
REQUIRED: 2+ symbol names AND 2+ file paths.
seeds: 2–4 symbol names  pins: 2–4 file paths

**Q_FULL** (combination — all signals):
Natural developer query. No constraints.
seeds: 2–4 central symbol names  pins: 2–4 key file paths

Each query MUST include a `"justification"` field: a brief explanation
of why this query text + these seeds/pins would lead to the relevant
code. This lets a reviewer verify the query is well-formed and the
seeds/pins are pre-implementation knowledge.

#### Non-OK queries (optional — only include those that arise naturally)

- **UNSAT** (up to 2): Factually wrong assumption. seeds: `[]` pins: `[]`
- **BROAD** (up to 2): 15+ files, 3+ directories. seeds: `[]` pins: `[]`
- **AMBIG** (up to 2): 2+ possible targets. seeds: `[]` pins: `[]`

SKIP any that feel forced.

### STEP 3 — VALIDATE

After writing each JSON, re-read it and verify:

1. **diff cross-check:** every function/method/class in the diff
   appears in `minimum_sufficient_defs` with reason `"edited:..."`
2. **minimum_sufficient:** would a skilled human fail without any of
   these? If not, move it to `thrash_preventing` or remove.
3. **thrash_preventing:** would an AI agent search for this if not
   given upfront? If not, remove it.
4. **tier_difference_reasoning:** does it accurately explain the delta
   between the two tiers?
5. **excluded:** did you open defs that aren't in either list? Add them
   to `excluded_defs` with reason.
6. **queries:** each follows REQUIRED/FORBIDDEN rules? Each has a
   justification?
7. **seeds/pins:** pre-implementation knowledge, not hindsight?
8. **completeness:** exactly 8 OK queries? Exact `query_type` strings?
9. **solve_notes, confidence, exploration_log** filled in?

Fix any issues before moving to the next task.
