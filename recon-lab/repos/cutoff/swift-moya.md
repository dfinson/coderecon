## Why this repo

- **Well-structured**: Clean protocol-oriented architecture —
  `TargetType` (defines API endpoints: `baseURL`, `path`, `method`,
  `task`, `headers`, `sampleData`), `Endpoint` (reified target with
  URL, method, task, sample response, and `urlRequest()` conversion),
  `MoyaProvider` (configurable request pipeline with `EndpointClosure`,
  `RequestClosure`, `StubClosure`, plugin support, and inflight
  request tracking), `Response` (status code, data, request, response),
  `MoyaError` (typed error hierarchy), `Task` (request body variants:
  plain, data, JSON, parameters, multipart, upload, download),
  `PluginType` (prepare, willSend, didReceive, process hooks), four
  built-in plugins (`NetworkLoggerPlugin`, `NetworkActivityPlugin`,
  `CredentialsPlugin`, `AccessTokenPlugin`), reactive extensions
  (`RxMoya`, `CombineMoya`, `ReactiveMoya`), and Alamofire integration.
- **Rich history**: 15K+ stars, 1.8K+ commits. The standard
  network abstraction layer for Swift/iOS, used extensively in
  iOS/macOS applications. Issues span stubbing edge cases, plugin
  ordering, multipart encoding, Combine integration, and error
  mapping.

## Narrow

### N1: Fix MoyaProvider inflight request tracking not removing entries after completion

In `Sources/Moya/MoyaProvider.swift`, `internalInflightRequests` is
a dictionary of `[Endpoint: [Moya.Completion]]` guarded by `@Atomic`.
When `trackInflights` is enabled, completed requests should be removed
from the dictionary. In `MoyaProvider+Internal.swift`, the completion
handler removes the endpoint key, but if a second request for the
same endpoint is added between the response arriving and the
completion callback executing, the removal erases the new request's
callback. Fix the removal logic to only remove the specific callback
instead of the entire endpoint entry.

### N2: Fix Endpoint.urlRequest() crashing for requestCompositeParameters with URLEncoding.default

In `Sources/Moya/Endpoint.swift`, the `urlRequest()` method handles
`.requestCompositeParameters(bodyParameters:bodyEncoding:urlParameters:)`.
It contains a `fatalError` when `bodyParameterEncoding` is a
`URLEncoding` with a destination other than `.httpBody`. However, the
error message is misleading — it says "prohibited" for `URLEncoding.default`
which uses `.methodDependent`, but for GET requests `methodDependent`
maps to query string, which is valid. Fix the guard to only reject
non-httpBody URLEncoding for methods that use body encoding (POST,
PUT, PATCH).

### N3: Fix CancellableToken not actually cancelling the underlying Alamofire request

In `Sources/Moya/Cancellable.swift`, `CancellableToken` stores a
closure `cancelAction` and a `lock` for thread safety. The `cancel()`
method sets `isCancelled = true` and executes `cancelAction`. However,
in `MoyaProvider+Internal.swift`, the `CancellableToken` is created
with an empty closure initially and later updated with the actual
Alamofire request's cancel. If `cancel()` is called before the
request is assigned, the empty closure executes and `isCancelled`
is set, but the actual request proceeds. Fix to store the request
reference atomically and cancel it even if assigned after `cancel()`.

### N4: Fix NetworkLoggerPlugin not redacting sensitive headers in log output

In `Sources/Moya/Plugins/NetworkLoggerPlugin.swift`, the plugin logs
request and response headers. The `Configuration` struct has a
`logOptions` set but no mechanism to redact sensitive headers like
`Authorization`, `Cookie`, or `Set-Cookie`. Fix by adding a
`sensitiveHeaders: Set<String>` configuration option and replacing
their values with `[REDACTED]` in the log output. Also update
`docs/Plugins.md` to document the new `sensitiveHeaders`
configuration option with usage examples.

### N5: Fix Response.filter(statusCodes:) not including the upper bound of the range

In `Sources/Moya/Response.swift`, `filter(statusCodes: Range<Int>)`
uses Swift's `Range` (half-open interval), so
`filter(statusCodes: 200..<300)` correctly excludes 300. However,
the convenience method `filterSuccessfulStatusCodes()` uses
`200...299` (`ClosedRange`), and there is no overload accepting
`ClosedRange`. If a user calls `filter(statusCodes: 200...299)`,
Swift selects the `Range` overload via implicit conversion, which
silently excludes 299. Fix by adding an explicit
`filter(statusCodes: ClosedRange<Int>)` overload.

### N6: Fix AccessTokenPlugin not applying token when TargetType declares .custom authorization

In `Sources/Moya/Plugins/AccessTokenPlugin.swift`, the `prepare`
method checks if the target conforms to `AccessTokenAuthorizable`
and reads `authorizationType`. The plugin handles `.bearer` and
`.basic` cases, but the `.custom(String)` case is not handled —
custom authorization schemes are silently ignored and no
`Authorization` header is set. Fix `prepare` to handle `.custom`
by prepending the custom scheme string to the token value.

### N7: Fix MultiTarget losing the inner target's sampleData when stubbing

In `Sources/Moya/MultiTarget.swift`, `MultiTarget` conforms to
`TargetType` and forwards all properties to the wrapped `target`.
The `sampleData` property returns `target.sampleData`. However,
when `MoyaProvider<MultiTarget>` stubs a request, the `Endpoint`
is created via `endpointClosure` which uses `MultiTarget`'s
`sampleData`. If the `EndpointClosure` captures the `MultiTarget`
instance and the inner target is deallocated, the sample data
reference becomes invalid. Fix by eagerly capturing `sampleData`
in the `Endpoint`'s `sampleResponseClosure`.

### N8: Fix ProgressResponse.progress returning 0.0 for uploads with known content length

In `Sources/Moya/MoyaProvider.swift`, `ProgressResponse.progress`
returns `progressObject.fractionCompleted` only when
`totalUnitCount > 0`. For upload tasks, Alamofire may not set
`totalUnitCount` on the `Progress` object until the upload begins.
During the initial phase, `totalUnitCount` is 0 and `progress`
returns 0.0 even though `completedUnitCount` is incrementing.
Fix the `progress` computed property to also check
`completedUnitCount > 0` as a signal that progress tracking has
started.

### N9: Fix MoyaProvider+Combine publisher not completing on cancellation

In `Sources/CombineMoya/MoyaPublisher.swift`, the `MoyaPublisher`
wraps a `MoyaProvider` request into a Combine `Publisher`. When
the subscription is cancelled, the underlying `Cancellable` is
cancelled, but the publisher never sends a `.finished` completion.
Downstream subscribers waiting for completion hang indefinitely.
Fix the cancellation handler to send `.finished` to the subscriber
before cancelling the underlying request.

### N10: Fix CredentialsPlugin not being called for stubbed requests

In `Sources/Moya/Plugins/CredentialsPlugin.swift`, the plugin
implements `willSend` to add URL credentials. In
`MoyaProvider+Internal.swift`, when a request is stubbed, the
`willSend` plugin hook is called with a `RequestTypeWrapper`. However,
the `RequestTypeWrapper` for stubbed requests does not support
`authenticate(with:)` — calling it is a no-op. Fix the stub
request flow to apply credentials to the `URLRequest` directly
before creating the stub response.

### N11: Fix docs/Plugins.md not documenting plugin lifecycle ordering constraints

The `docs/Plugins.md` documentation describes each built-in plugin
individually but does not explain the order in which plugin hooks
(`prepare`, `willSend`, `didReceive`, `process`) execute when
multiple plugins are registered. Users combining
`AccessTokenPlugin` with `NetworkLoggerPlugin` may see the
`Authorization` header logged before it is applied, depending on
plugin order. The `docs/Providers.md` file references plugins but
does not link to `docs/Plugins.md`. The `.github/Issue_template.md`
does not ask reporters to list their registered plugins and their
order. Fix `docs/Plugins.md` to add a "Plugin Ordering" section
with a lifecycle sequence diagram, add a cross-reference link from
`docs/Providers.md` to the plugins documentation, and add a
"Registered plugins" field to `.github/Issue_template.md`.

## Medium

### M1: Implement request interceptor plugin for token refresh flow

Add a `TokenRefreshPlugin` that intercepts 401 responses,
refreshes the access token, and retries the original request.
Requires a new `Sources/Moya/Plugins/TokenRefreshPlugin.swift`,
`TokenRefreshDelegate` protocol for token refresh logic, retry
state management with retry count limit, thread-safe token
storage via `@Atomic`, integration with `process` plugin hook,
and tests.

### M2: Add response caching plugin with ETag and If-Modified-Since support

Implement `CachingPlugin` that caches responses by endpoint and
automatically sends conditional requests. Requires
`Sources/Moya/Plugins/CachingPlugin.swift`, `CacheStore` protocol
with in-memory default implementation, ETag and Last-Modified
header extraction, conditional request header injection via
`prepare`, cache hit/miss metrics, configurable per-endpoint TTL,
tests, and a new section in `docs/Plugins.md` documenting the
caching plugin configuration and an update to `Changelog.md`
with the new feature entry.

### M3: Implement request batching for multiple concurrent API calls

Add `MoyaProvider.requestBatch(targets:)` that sends multiple
requests concurrently and returns all results together. Requires
extensions to `MoyaProvider.swift`, `BatchResponse` result type
with per-target results, `DispatchGroup`-based coordination,
partial failure handling (some succeed, some fail), Combine
publisher variant, and tests.

### M4: Add offline mode plugin with request queuing and replay

Implement `OfflineModePlugin` that queues requests when the
network is unavailable and replays them when connectivity
returns. Requires `Sources/Moya/Plugins/OfflineModePlugin.swift`,
`RequestQueue` for persistent request storage (Codable
serialization), network reachability monitoring, queue processing
on reconnection, configurable queue limit, and tests.

### M5: Implement structured concurrency support with async/await API

Add `async`/`await` support to `MoyaProvider`: `request(_ target:) async throws -> Response`,
`requestWithProgress(_ target:) -> AsyncStream<ProgressResponse>`.
Requires `Sources/Moya/MoyaProvider+Async.swift`,
`CheckedContinuation` wrapping of callback-based API, cancellation
propagation via `Task`, `AsyncStream` for progress, async plugin
hooks, and tests.

### M6: Add mock server for integration testing without network

Implement `MockMoyaServer` that serves stub responses via a local
HTTP server, allowing real network stack testing. Requires
`Sources/Moya/Testing/MockServer.swift`, `LocalHTTPServer` using
`NWListener`, route registration from `TargetType.sampleData`,
configurable latency simulation, response sequence support
(different responses for successive requests), and tests.

### M7: Implement request signing plugin for HMAC-based API authentication

Add `RequestSigningPlugin` that signs requests with HMAC-SHA256
using a shared secret. Requires
`Sources/Moya/Plugins/RequestSigningPlugin.swift`, canonical
request string construction (method, path, headers, body hash),
signature computation via `CryptoKit`, timestamp injection,
signed headers specification, nonce generation, and tests.

### M8: Add response mapping pipeline with typed decoders

Implement a `DecodableProvider<Target>` wrapper that adds typed
response decoding: `request(target, as: Model.self)` returning
`Result<Model, MoyaError>`. Requires
`Sources/Moya/DecodableProvider.swift`, `JSONDecoder` configuration
per target, `keyDecodingStrategy` support, error response
decoding for API error bodies, partial response handling,
Combine integration, and tests.

### M9: Implement request throttling with rate limiting

Add `ThrottlePlugin` that limits concurrent requests per endpoint
or globally, queuing excess requests. Requires
`Sources/Moya/Plugins/ThrottlePlugin.swift`, `Semaphore`-based
concurrency limiting, per-endpoint max concurrent configuration,
queue priority support, timeout for queued requests, and tests.

### M10: Add multipart upload progress with per-part tracking

Implement per-part progress tracking for multipart uploads:
`uploadMultipart(target, partProgress: (String, Double) -> Void)`.
Requires extending `MoyaProvider.swift` with part-aware progress,
`MultipartProgress` struct with part name and fraction,
Alamofire `MultipartFormData` integration for per-part byte
counting, aggregated total progress, and tests.

### M11: Update docs/MigrationGuides/ and Changelog.md for version migration documentation

The `docs/MigrationGuides/` directory contains seven migration
guides (`migration_8_to_9.md` through `migration_14_to_15.md`) but
the guides do not follow a consistent format — some include code
examples and others only have prose descriptions. The
`Changelog.md` does not cross-reference migration guides for
breaking-change entries. The `docs_CN/` Chinese documentation
directory is missing migration guides entirely (it has a
`Development.md` not present in `docs/` but lacks the
`MigrationGuides/` subdirectory). The `Contributing.md` does not
mention the requirement to update migration guides when introducing
breaking API changes. The `.circleci/config.yml` CI configuration
does not verify that documentation builds successfully.
Standardize all migration guides in `docs/MigrationGuides/` to a
consistent template, add migration guide cross-references to
`Changelog.md` breaking-change entries, add Chinese migration
guide stubs to `docs_CN/`, update `Contributing.md` with migration
guide requirements, and add a docs build verification step to
`.circleci/config.yml`.

### W11: Overhaul docs/, docs_CN/, and CI configuration

The `docs/` and `docs_CN/` documentation directories are out of
sync — `docs/` has `Testing.md` but `docs_CN/` does not, while
`docs_CN/` has `Development.md` but `docs/` does not. The
`docs/README.md` index page does not link to all documentation
files. The `docs/Releasing.md` release guide references
CocoaPods trunk push but does not mention Swift Package Manager
tagging or the `.circleci/config.yml` CI pipeline. The
`Vision.md` and `Vision_CN.md` project vision documents reference
RxSwift but do not mention Combine, which is now a supported
reactive framework. The `Readme_CN.md` Chinese README is not
kept in sync with `Readme.md` — it is missing the Combine
installation instructions. The `.swiftlint.yml` configuration
has no `excluded` paths for generated files or test fixtures.
The `codecov.yml` code coverage configuration does not set a
minimum coverage threshold. The `.github/stale.yml` stale issue
bot configuration uses a 60-day timeout with no exempt labels.
Sync `docs/` and `docs_CN/` to have matching files, update
`docs/README.md` with complete links, update
`docs/Releasing.md` with SPM release steps, update
`Vision.md`/`Vision_CN.md` to mention Combine, sync
`Readme_CN.md` with `Readme.md`, configure `.swiftlint.yml`
exclusions, set a coverage threshold in `codecov.yml`, and
add exempt labels to `.github/stale.yml`.
