## Why this repo

- **Multi-crate workspace**: axum (main), axum-core (traits), axum-extra (extensions), axum-macros (proc macros)
- **Tower-based**: Built on tower `Service` trait with composable middleware layers
- **Type-driven extractors**: Request decomposition via `FromRequest`/`FromRequestParts` traits, compile-time handler validation

## Narrow

### N1: Improve `MatchedPath` rejection message for `nest_service` contexts

When `Router::nest_service` is used to nest a non-axum Tower service, the `MatchedPath` extension is not set for requests routed to that service. The outer wildcard match is stored in a private `MatchedNestedPath` extension, which is inaccessible to users. Handlers or middleware inside the nested service that extract `MatchedPath` receive a `MatchedPathMissing` rejection with the terse body "No matched path found" and no diagnostic guidance. Improve the `MatchedPathMissing` rejection body in `axum/src/extract/rejection.rs` to include a hint explaining when matched path can be unavailable, and update the `MatchedPath` documentation in `axum/src/extract/matched_path.rs` to document the `nest_service` limitation.

### N2: Fix `WebSocketUpgrade` incorrectly requiring `Sec-WebSocket-Version` for HTTP/2

The `WebSocketUpgrade` extractor in `extract/ws.rs` validates the `Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13` header for all upgrade requests regardless of HTTP version. The check at line 488 runs outside the HTTP/1.1 branch and therefore also applies to HTTP/2 extended CONNECT upgrades (RFC 8441). RFC 8441 does not require `Sec-WebSocket-Version` for HTTP/2 WebSocket connections. HTTP/2 clients that omit this header are incorrectly rejected with `InvalidWebSocketVersionHeader`. Move the `Sec-WebSocket-Version` check inside the `parts.version <= Version::HTTP_11` branch so it only applies to HTTP/1.1 connections.

### N3: Add `Router::has_routes` check for empty method routers

`Router::has_routes` returns `true` if any paths are registered, but does not account for paths that have only a fallback and no actual method handlers. A `Router::new().route("/health", MethodRouter::new())` registers a path with no methods but `has_routes()` returns `true`.

### N4: Fix `Path` extractor percent-decoding not handling `%2F` in segments

The `Path` extractor in `extract/path/mod.rs` percent-decodes path parameters, but `%2F` (forward slash) is decoded into `/`, which can break downstream logic that splits on `/`. The extractor should preserve `%2F` as-is in individual path segments.

### N5: Improve `MethodRouter::merge` fallback conflict error message

When calling `MethodRouter::merge` on two method routers that both define a custom fallback handler, the operation panics with "Cannot merge two `MethodRouter`s that both have a fallback" (in `axum/src/routing/method_routing.rs`). Unlike the method-specific conflict messages that identify the HTTP method (e.g., "Cannot merge two method routes that both define `GET`"), the fallback conflict message provides no guidance on how to resolve the conflict or what a fallback means in this context. Improve the fallback conflict error message to clarify that the fallback handles all unmatched methods and suggest using `MethodRouter::layer` for shared behavior or removing one of the custom fallbacks.

### N6: Add `Redirect::see_other` convenience constructor

`Redirect` provides `to`, `permanent`, and `temporary` constructors but not `see_other` (303). POST-redirect-GET flows commonly need 303 status. Add `Redirect::see_other(uri)` that returns a 303 redirect response. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new API addition and add a usage example to `README.md`.

### N7: Fix SSE `Event::retry` panicking instead of overwriting on repeated calls

In `response/sse.rs`, the `Event::retry` builder method panics when called more than once on the same `Event` instance ("Called `Event::retry` multiple times"). This is inconsistent with other `Event` setter methods (e.g., `event` and `id` which also panic, but unlike them, `retry` has no semantic reason to forbid overwriting since the last value wins per the SSE spec). The panic can cause unexpected crashes when application code conditionally builds events and calls `retry` in multiple code paths. Change `Event::retry` to silently overwrite any previously set retry duration rather than panicking.

### N8: Fix `ConnectInfo` not available in middleware added via `Router::layer`

When middleware added via `Router::layer` tries to extract `ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>`, it fails because `ConnectInfo` is inserted by `into_make_service_with_connect_info` which runs after the layer. Document this limitation and add a compile-time-friendly error message in the rejection.

### N9: Add `#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented]` to `FromRef` for better `State` error messages

The `FromRef<T>` trait in `axum-core/src/extract/from_ref.rs` lacks a `#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented]` attribute. When a handler uses `State<T>` and the type `T` does not implement `FromRef<S>` for the router's state type `S`, the compiler emits a generic trait-bound error with no guidance on how to fix it. Add `#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented(message = "...", note = "...")]` to the `FromRef` trait with a helpful message directing users to implement `FromRef`, derive it via `#[derive(FromRef)]`, or ensure the state type passed to `with_state` matches the type used in `State<T>`.

### N10: Fix `serve` not propagating `TcpListener` SO_KEEPALIVE setting

The `serve` function in `serve/mod.rs` accepts a `TcpListener` but does not configure TCP keepalive on accepted connections. Long-lived idle connections (e.g., SSE, WebSocket) can be silently dropped by intermediate proxies without keepalive probes.

### N11: Fix `CHANGELOG.md` not documenting breaking changes from axum-core extractor trait signature updates

The `CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root does not include entries for breaking changes introduced in axum-core's `FromRequest` and `FromRequestParts` trait modifications. Contributors updating extractors have no changelog guidance. Add a changelog policy section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and backfill missing breaking-change entries in `CHANGELOG.md` referencing the relevant axum-core commits.

## Medium

### M1: Implement request body size limiting middleware

Add middleware that enforces a maximum request body size, returning 413 Payload Too Large when exceeded. Integrate with `DefaultBodyLimit` from axum-core but allow per-route override via `Router::route_layer`. Handle streaming bodies by counting bytes as they are read. Add a body-limit example to the `examples/` directory and document configuration in `ECOSYSTEM.md`.

### M2: Add typed multipart form extractor with struct derivation

Implement a `#[derive(TypedMultipart)]` macro in axum-macros that generates `FromRequest` for structs representing multipart form uploads. Map struct fields to form fields by name, support `Vec<u8>` for file contents and `String` for text parts. Changes span axum-macros and axum-extra's multipart module.

### M3: Add configurable drain timeout to `WithGracefulShutdown`

`Serve::with_graceful_shutdown(signal)` stops accepting new connections when the signal fires and sends HTTP connection-close notifications to active connections, but waits indefinitely for all connections to close. If a long-lived connection (e.g., SSE or WebSocket) does not close after receiving the shutdown notification, the server never exits. Add a `WithGracefulShutdown::with_drain_timeout(duration)` method to `axum/src/serve/mod.rs` that cancels remaining connections after the specified drain duration. When the timeout expires, forcibly close any connections still open and resolve the server future. Changes span `serve/mod.rs` and its test suite.

### M4: Add response caching middleware with ETag support

Implement middleware that caches response bodies by route pattern, computes weak ETags from body hashes, and returns 304 Not Modified for matching `If-None-Match` requests. Support configurable TTL and cache invalidation. Changes touch middleware module and response handling.

### M5: Implement extractor for validated JSON with custom error responses

Add a `ValidatedJson<T>` extractor that deserializes and validates the request body using a validation trait. Return structured error responses with field-level error details instead of axum's default rejection. Changes span a new extractor in axum-extra and rejection handling in axum-core.

### M6: Add request timeout middleware with per-route configuration

Implement timeout middleware that wraps handler futures with `tokio::time::timeout`. Support per-route timeout values via route-layer. When the timeout expires, return 504 and cancel the handler future. Handle cleanup for WebSocket upgrades. Changes touch middleware module, routing, and handler future.

### M7: Implement session middleware with pluggable storage

Add cookie-based session middleware that stores session data server-side. Support in-memory and Redis storage backends. Implement session ID rotation, expiration, and secure cookie attributes. Changes span axum-extra's cookie module, a new session module, and middleware integration.

### M8: Add health check endpoint with readiness/liveness separation

Implement a health check framework with `HealthCheck` trait, readiness vs. liveness probe distinction, and aggregate health status. Support async health checks with timeout. Add `Router` extension method for registering health endpoints. Changes touch routing and add a new health module in axum-extra.

### M9: Implement form-data extractor with file streaming to disk

Add a `StreamingMultipart` extractor that streams uploaded files directly to disk without buffering the entire file in memory. Support configurable temp directory, max file size, and filename sanitization. Changes span axum's multipart extractor and axum-extra.

### M10: Add metrics middleware collecting request duration and status histograms

Implement middleware that measures request processing time, records HTTP method, route pattern, and status code, and exposes metrics via a Prometheus-compatible endpoint. Changes touch middleware module, routing (for matched-path extraction), and add a metrics response endpoint.

### M11: Add CI workflow for automated API compatibility checking

Extend `.github/workflows/CI.yml` to include an API compatibility check step using `cargo-semver-checks` that validates all four crates (axum, axum-core, axum-extra, axum-macros) against their previous published versions. Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with semver policy, add a `deny.toml` rule for detecting accidental public API removals, and document the CI pipeline in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
