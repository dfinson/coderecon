# recon-lab

Training pipeline for CodeRecon's recon models. Produces three LightGBM
models that ship as package data in `src/coderecon/ranking/data/`:

| Model | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Ranker | `ranker.lgbm` | LambdaMART object scorer — P(touched \| query, object) |
| Cutoff | `cutoff.lgbm` | Regressor — predict how many top objects to return |
| Gate | `gate.lgbm` | Multiclass classifier — OK / UNSAT / BROAD / AMBIG |

---

## 1. Foundations

### 1.1 Semantic Object

The unit of prediction is a **DefFact**: a row in the `def_facts` table with a
stable `def_uid`, `kind`, `name`, `lexical_path`, `start_line`, `end_line`,
and file reference.

DefFact kinds across languages:

| Kind | Category | What it is |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `function` | Code | Top-level function |
| `method` | Code | Method inside a class/struct/trait |
| `class` | Code | Class definition |
| `struct` | Code | Struct (Rust, Go, C#) |
| `interface` | Code | Interface (TS, Go, Java, C#) |
| `trait` | Code | Trait (Rust) |
| `enum` | Code | Enum |
| `variable` | Code | Top-level or module-level variable |
| `constant` | Code | Named constant |
| `module` | Code | Module declaration |
| `property` | Code | Property (getter/setter) |
| `pair` | Non-code | Config key-value (TOML/YAML/JSON) |
| `key` | Non-code | Config key |
| `table` | Non-code | Config section (TOML) |
| `target` | Non-code | Build target (Makefile) |
| `heading` | Non-code | Document heading (Markdown) |

### 1.2 Retrieval Signals

Five retrieval sources produce candidates. Each returns its full natural
result set — no artificial caps, no budget limits.

| Signal | Source | Granularity |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Embedding | Dense vector similarity (bge-small-en-v1.5, 384-dim) | Per code-def or per non-code-file |
| Lexical | Tantivy full-text search | Line hits mapped to containing DefFact |
| Term match | SQL LIKE on DefFact names | Per DefFact |
| Graph | 1-hop structural walk (callees, callers, siblings) | Per DefFact |
| Symbol/Explicit | Direct symbol/path resolution from query text, seeds, and pins | Per DefFact |

Harvesters emit raw measurements only — no pre-scored evidence, no
hardcoded weights. Categorical features (`graph_edge_type`,
`symbol_source`, `import_direction`) replace numeric scores. The ranker
learns signal value from data.

### 1.3 Query Tiers

Eight OK query tiers: five isolation (each exercises a single retrieval
signal) and three combination (exercise multi-signal agreement).
Seeds and pins are separate arguments alongside the query text.

**Isolation tiers** (one signal each):

| Tier | Name | Primary signal | Seeds | Pins |
|------|------|---------------|-------|------|
| **Q_SEMANTIC** | Semantic | Embedding | none | none |
| **Q_LEXICAL** | Lexical | Full-text / Tantivy | none | none |
| **Q_IDENTIFIER** | Identifier | Term match (SQL LIKE) | none | none |
| **Q_STRUCTURAL** | Structural | Graph (1-hop walk) | 1–2 | none |
| **Q_NAVIGATIONAL** | Navigational | Explicit path/symbol resolution | none | 2–4 |

**Combination tiers** (multi-signal):

| Tier | Name | Signals combined | Seeds | Pins |
|------|------|-----------------|-------|------|
| **Q_SEM_IDENT** | Semantic + Identifier | Embedding + term match | 2–3 | none |
| **Q_IDENT_NAV** | Identifier + Navigational | Term match + explicit | 2–4 | 2–4 |
| **Q_FULL** | Full signal | All signals | 2–4 | 2–4 |

**Non-OK tiers** (up to 4 each, optional — skip if forced):

| Tier | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **UNSAT** | Query makes factually wrong assumptions about the repo |
| **BROAD** | Work spanning 15+ files in 3+ unrelated directories |
| **AMBIG** | 2+ subsystems could be the target; query doesn't specify which |

Total per task: 8 required OK + 0–12 optional non-OK = 8–20 queries.

### 1.4 Gate Taxonomy

Four labels, defined as properties of the **(query, repo) pair**:

| Label | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| **OK** | The query maps to a specific, bounded neighborhood of semantic objects. |
| **UNSAT** | The query makes factually wrong assumptions about the repo. |
| **BROAD** | The touched set is structurally dispersed — no ranked list with a reasonable cutoff achieves acceptable precision and recall. |
| **AMBIG** | Multiple disjoint neighborhoods could plausibly be the target. |

### 1.5 Relevance Model

Graded (3-level). The ranker learns to prioritize minimum_sufficient
defs over thrash_preventing defs, so that under budget pressure the
must-see context survives the cutoff.

| Gain | Tier | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| 2 | `minimum_sufficient` | Human-necessary — removing this def causes task failure |
| 1 | `thrash_preventing` | Agent-necessary — removing this causes extra searches but task is still solvable |
| 0 | irrelevant | Not relevant to the task |

LambdaMART natively optimizes NDCG with graded gains.

---

## 2. Models

### 2.1 Object Ranker (Model 1)

**Goal:** Score $P(\text{relevant} \mid q, o)$ for each candidate DefFact.

**Base model:** LightGBM LambdaMART. Graded relevance gains (2/1/0).
Grouped by `(run_id, query_id)`. Only OK-labeled queries.

**Per-candidate features:**

```
# Identity
def_uid, path, kind, name, lexical_path

# Span
start_line, end_line, object_size_lines

# Path features
file_ext, parent_dir, path_depth

# Structural metadata from index
has_docstring, has_decorators, has_return_type
hub_score, is_test, signature_text, namespace
nesting_depth, has_parent_scope

# Retriever signals (None if retriever didn't find this def)
emb_score, emb_rank
term_match_count, term_total_matches
lex_hit_count
graph_edge_type, graph_seed_rank
symbol_source
import_direction
retriever_hits
```

### 2.2 Cutoff (Model 2)

**Goal:** Predict $N(q)$: how many top-ranked objects to return.

**Base model:** LightGBM regressor. Target: $N^*(q) = \arg\max_N F_1$.

**Features:** query features + repo features + score distribution
(percentiles, gaps, entropy, variance, cumulative mass) + retriever
agreement distribution.

**Training:** K-fold across all 50 repos. Out-of-fold ranker predictions
→ compute $N^*$ per query → 7,500 rows, no leakage.

### 2.3 Gate (Model 3)

**Goal:** Classify (query, repo) as OK / UNSAT / BROAD / AMBIG.

**Base model:** LightGBM multiclass. Cross-entropy objective.

**Features:** query text features + repo features + retrieval
distribution features (top score, score decay, path entropy, cluster
count, retriever agreement, seed presence).

| Gate output | Action |
|------------|--------|
| OK | Ranker + cutoff → return ranked DefFacts |
| UNSAT | Surface mismatch |
| AMBIG | Ask for disambiguation |
| BROAD | Ask for decomposition |

---

## 3. Runtime Flow

```
Query + Seeds + Pins
  │
  ├─ Embedding query (def matrix + file matrix)
  ├─ Lexical search (Tantivy)
  ├─ Term match (SQL LIKE)
  ├─ Symbol/path resolution (seeds + pins + query text)
  │
  ▼
Candidate pool (union by def_uid, per-retriever raw signals)
  │
  ├─ Graph walk (1-hop from candidates with ≥2 signals or explicit)
  │
  ▼
Full candidate pool + features
  │
  ├─ Gate classifies (query, repo)
  │     ├─ UNSAT → surface mismatch
  │     ├─ AMBIG → ask for disambiguation
  │     ├─ BROAD → ask for decomposition
  │     └─ OK ──┐
  │              ▼
  │     Ranker scores each candidate
  │              ▼
  │     Cutoff predicts N(q)
  │              ▼
  │     Return top N ranked DefFacts
  │
  ▼
Response to agent (ranked semantic spans)
```

**Output:** ranked list of DefFacts. No file tiers. No file-level
grouping. No test co-retrieval. Presentation is the consumer's concern.

---

## 4. Dataset Generation

### 4.1 Repo Selection

Three repo sets, 98 repos total:

- **Ranker + Gate** (30 repos): train ranker and gate. 10 languages × 3 repos.
- **Cutoff** (48 repos): train cutoff with disjoint data. Medium-scale repos
  with varied codebase sizes for diverse N* distributions, plus small and
  large scale anchors for N* range coverage.
  No K-fold needed — cutoff repos are scored by the ranker trained on the
  ranker+gate set, so no leakage. Gate also trains on these repos
  (gate uses raw signals, not ranker output, so no leakage).
- **Eval** (20 repos): held-out evaluation. 10 languages × 2 repos each.

All repos generate the same full query set: 8 OK queries + up to 12
non-OK queries per task. Gate uses all queries from all 78 training
repos. Cutoff uses only OK queries from cutoff repos.

**Total:** 98 repos, 3,234 tasks, ~28,000+ queries.

### 4.2 Task Generation

33 tasks per repo (10 narrow / 10 medium / 10 wide + 3 non-code-focused).
Each task is a natural-language description of work — no code, no diffs,
no hints.

### 4.3 Data Collection Pipeline

Four phases, three agent roles + one automated step:

- **Phase 1 — Pre-flight audit** (Role 1): validate tasks against the
  actual repo; correct the md file if needed.
- **Phase 2 — Solve + Reflect** (Role 2): solve each task, produce
  ground truth JSON with exploration log.
- **Phase 3 — Review** (Role 3): verify executor outputs, correct
  JSONs in-place, fill `reviewer_corrections`.
- **Phase 4 — Signal collection** (automated, re-runnable).

Role prompts live in `roles/`:

| File | Role | Job |
|------|------|-----|
| `roles/auditor.md` | Pre-flight Auditor | Verify tasks are grounded, coherent, scoped, solvable. Edit md to fix bad tasks. |
| `roles/executor.md` | Task Executor | Solve tasks, capture exploration process, produce ground truth JSON. |
| `roles/reviewer.md` | Outputs Reviewer | Verify executor outputs, simulate solving independently, correct JSONs in-place. |

#### Orchestrator stages

The `gt_orchestrator.py` runs these as sequential gated stages via the
Copilot SDK:

| # | Stage | Model | Sessions | What it does |
|---|-------|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Audit** | Sonnet 4.6 | 98 | Verify all 33 tasks are grounded in code |
| 2 | **Exec N** | Opus 4.6 | 98 | Solve N1-N11 (narrow tasks), write ground truth JSONs |
| 3 | **Exec M** | Opus 4.6 | 98 | Solve M1-M11 (medium tasks), write ground truth JSONs |
| 4 | **Exec W** | Opus 4.6 | 98 | Solve W1-W11 (wide tasks) + non-OK queries, write JSONs |
| 5 | **Review** | Opus 4.6 | 98 | Verify all executor output, fix schema/content issues |

Each stage must complete for **all 98 repos** before the next stage begins.

#### Invocation

Each role runs as a separate agent session inside the cloned repo:

```
# Role 1: Pre-flight audit
"Read ../../repos/{set}/{repo}.md as the Pre-flight Auditor.
 Your role instructions are in ../../roles/auditor.md.
 Read both files thoroughly, then do your job."

# Role 2: Task execution
"Read ../../repos/{set}/{repo}.md as the Task Executor.
 Your role instructions are in ../../roles/executor.md.
 Read both files thoroughly, then do your job."

# Role 3: Outputs review
"Read ../../repos/{set}/{repo}.md as the Outputs Reviewer.
 Your role instructions are in ../../roles/reviewer.md.
 Read both files thoroughly, then do your job."
```

#### Ground truth JSON schema

Each task produces one file: `data/{repo_id}/ground_truth/{heading_id}.json`.

```json
{
  "task_id": "python-fastapi/N1",
  "task_complexity": "narrow",
  "task_text": "<verbatim from md>",
  "diff": "<raw git diff>",
  "solve_notes": "<1-3 sentences>",
  "exploration_log": {
    "search_sequence": [
      {"action": "...", "result": "...", "reasoning": "..."}
    ],
    "dead_ends": [
      {"explored": "...", "why_irrelevant": "..."}
    ],
    "key_decisions": [
      {"decision": "...", "alternatives": ["..."], "reasoning": "..."}
    ],
    "aha_moment": "...",
    "hindsight": "..."
  },
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "minimum_sufficient_defs": [
    {"path": "...", "name": "...", "kind": "...", "start_line": 42, "reason": "edited:|read: ..."}
  ],
  "thrash_preventing_defs": [
    {"path": "...", "name": "...", "kind": "...", "start_line": 87, "reason": "read: ..."}
  ],
  "tier_difference_reasoning": "<why the two tiers differ or are identical>",
  "excluded_defs": [
    {"path": "...", "name": "...", "kind": "...", "reason": "..."}
  ],
  "queries": [
    {"query_type": "Q_SEMANTIC", "query_text": "...", "seeds": [], "pins": [], "justification": "..."}
  ],
  "reviewer_corrections": "<filled by Role 3: corrections summary or 'No corrections required'>"
}
```

Field details, query type rules, seed/pin rules, and validation
checklist are in `roles/executor.md` (the canonical reference).

#### Data assembly

1. For each def in `minimum_sufficient_defs` and `thrash_preventing_defs`:
   look up `(path, name, kind)` in coderecon index → resolve `def_uid`.
2. If no match: flag for review (should be <2%).
3. Write `touched_objects.jsonl` with `tier` field (`minimum` or `thrash_preventing`).
   The ranker trains on the union (both tiers = relevant).
4. Write `audit/` with `diff`, `justification`, `excluded_defs`,
   `confidence`, `solve_notes` for third-agent auditing.
5. Assemble `runs.jsonl`, `queries.jsonl`.

#### GT output

Each repo produces one file: `$CPL_LAB_WORKSPACE/data/{repo_id}/ground_truth.jsonl` — 34 lines:
- Lines 1-33: task ground truth (N1-N11, M1-M11, W1-W11)
- Line 34: non-OK queries (UNSAT, BROAD, AMBIG)

#### Phase 4: Retrieval signal collection (re-runnable)

For each query in ground truth:

```
recon_raw_signals(query=query_text, seeds=seeds, pins=pins)
```

Returns candidate pool with per-retriever raw signals. Seeds/pins
affect the pool: seeded symbols enter via the explicit harvester
(`symbol_source="agent_seed"`), pinned paths inject all defs from
those files (`symbol_source="pin"`).

Join with ground truth → `label_relevant` per candidate (binary).

#### Phase 4b: Test relevance data (collected with ground truth)

During Phase 2, the executor also runs the test suite with coverage
enabled. The executor itself analyzes the coverage results and
identifies which pre-existing test functions cover the changed lines.
The reviewer verifies this analysis.

**What the executor does:**

1. Runs the test suite with coverage against the reverted state
   (pre-change baseline).
2. Reads the coverage report to find which test functions cover the
   lines that were changed in the task commit diff.
3. Excludes any test functions the executor wrote as part of the task
   (new tests are in the diff — they're not pre-existing ground truth).
4. Constructs a single `test_query` describing the full diff:
   `"Find tests that verify the behavior of {symbols} in {files}"`
   where symbols and files come from the diff. One query per task —
   all changed symbols and files in one sentence.
5. Constructs `diff_seeds` (changed symbol names from the diff) and
   `diff_pins` (changed file paths from the diff).
6. Records all of this in the `test_selection` field of the ground
   truth JSON.

**What the reviewer verifies:**

1. `test_query` accurately describes the changed symbols and files.
2. `relevant_preexisting_tests` only contains tests that actually
   exist in the pre-change codebase (not new tests).
3. The `covers_changed_lines` reference real line numbers from the diff.
4. `diff_seeds` and `diff_pins` match the actual diff content.
5. `new_tests_excluded` lists all new test functions from the diff.

**Ground truth labels:**

| Field | What it contains | Source |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `test_query` | Natural language query describing the full diff | Executor constructs from diff |
| `relevant_preexisting_tests` | Pre-existing test DefFacts that cover changed lines | Executor analyzes coverage + diff |
| `import_graph_test_files` | Test files that import changed modules | Executor identifies from imports |
| `diff_seeds` | Changed symbol names | Executor extracts from diff |
| `diff_pins` | Changed file paths | Executor extracts from diff |
| `new_tests_excluded` | New test functions written by executor | Executor identifies from diff |

The `relevant_preexisting_tests` set is the ground truth for test
selection. The `import_graph_test_files` set is the baseline (current
checkpoint behavior). The ratio |import_graph| / |relevant| measures
over-selection.

## 5. Training Data Schemas

### 5.1 `runs`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `run_id` | str | Unique task run identifier |
| `repo_id` | str | Repository identifier |
| `task_id` | str | Task identifier |
| `task_text` | str | Full task description |

### 5.2 `touched_objects`

One row per relevant def per task. Absence = irrelevant.
Two tiers: `minimum` (human-necessary) and `thrash_preventing`
(agent-necessary). The ranker trains on the union of both.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `run_id` | str | Task run identifier |
| `def_uid` | str | DefFact stable identity |
| `path` | str | File path |
| `kind` | str | DefFact kind |
| `name` | str | DefFact name |
| `start_line` | int | Span start |
| `end_line` | int | Span end |
| `tier` | str | `minimum` or `thrash_preventing` |

### 5.3 `queries`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `run_id` | str | Task run identifier |
| `query_id` | str | Unique query identifier |
| `query_text` | str | Full query text |
| `query_type` | str | Q_SEMANTIC / Q_LEXICAL / Q_IDENTIFIER / Q_STRUCTURAL / Q_NAVIGATIONAL / Q_SEM_IDENT / Q_IDENT_NAV / Q_FULL / UNSAT / BROAD / AMBIG |
| `seeds` | list[str] | Symbol names passed as seeds |
| `pins` | list[str] | File paths passed as pins |
| `label_gate` | str | OK / UNSAT / BROAD / AMBIG |

Non-OK queries live in a separate per-repo file:
`data/{repo_id}/non_ok_queries.json`. They are merged into `queries`
during data assembly with `label_gate` set to the query type.

### 5.4 `candidates_rank`

One group per `(run_id, query_id)`. Per-candidate features from
`recon_raw_signals` output + binary relevance label.

### 5.5 `queries_cutoff`

One row per OK query from CUTOFF repos only. Score distribution
features from ranker output (ranker trained on ranker+gate repos)
+ $N^*$ target.

### 5.6 `queries_gate`

One row per query (all types). Retrieval distribution features +
gate label.

---

## 6. Training Procedures

### 6.1 Ranker

1. Filter to OK-labeled queries.
2. Train LightGBM LambdaMART grouped by `(run_id, query_id)`.
3. Graded relevance: 2 (minimum_sufficient), 1 (thrash_preventing), 0.

### 6.2 Cutoff (disjoint repo split)

1. Train ranker on 30 ranker+gate repos.
2. Score all 48 cutoff repos with the trained ranker.
3. Compute $N^*$ per cutoff query.
4. Zero leakage (ranker never saw cutoff data).
5. Train cutoff regressor.

### 6.3 Gate

1. All query types (OK + UNSAT + BROAD + AMBIG) from ALL 78 training
   repos (30 ranker+gate + 48 cutoff).
2. Retrieval distribution features from candidate pools.
3. LightGBM multiclass, cross-entropy.

### 6.4 Shipment Sequence

1. Data collection (30 ranker+gate repos, 48 cutoff repos, 20 eval repos)
2. Gate training (all 78 training repos) → gate ships
3. Ranker training (30 ranker+gate repos) → validate NDCG on eval set
4. Cutoff training (48 cutoff repos scored by trained ranker)
5. Full pipeline ships (gate + ranker + cutoff)

---

## 7. Evaluation

Uses the EVEE benchmarking framework.

**Metrics** (reported per query type):

| Metric | Granularity |
|--------|-------------|
| NDCG of ranked list | Per query |
| F1 / precision / recall of returned set | Per query |
| Gate accuracy + confusion matrix | Per query / aggregate |
| Empty-result rate | Aggregate |
| Returned-set size | Aggregate |

**Comparison:** head-to-head with heuristic recon baseline on F1 delta,
precision delta, recall delta, and latency.

**Agent trace collection:** During eval set runs, export VS Code chat
replays (raw JSON) to `data/{repo_id}/replays/`. The raw export
contains full LLM request metadata (tokens, timing, TTFT, cache hits),
tool call args/responses, conversation context, and agent reasoning.
Run `chatreplay_to_traces.py` post-collection to extract compressed
traces for efficiency metrics (turns, tokens, tool calls). Keep raw
exports as source of truth — they can be re-extracted with richer
formats later.

---

## 8. Design Invariants

Every numeric boundary is either learned from data (ranker scores,
cutoff N, gate boundaries), a system configuration parameter
(rendering budget), or computed empirically per query ($N^*$).

No artificial caps in retrievers. No hardcoded evidence scores. No
arbitrary constants in model definitions, feature computations, or
training procedures. Seeds and pins inject candidates but do not boost
scores — the ranker decides their value. Graph seeds = candidates
found by ≥2 retrievers or explicitly mentioned, no scoring formula.

Non-code files use file-level embeddings only. Their synthetic defs
enter the candidate pool via file-embedding expansion. The ranker
treats them identically to code defs.

## 10. CLI Reference

All pipeline stages are orchestrated via the `recon-lab` CLI:

```bash
cd recon-lab && source .venv/bin/activate

# Clone repos
recon-lab clone --set ranker-gate
recon-lab clone --set all

# Index cloned repos
recon-lab index

# Generate ground truth (§4.3)
recon-lab generate run
recon-lab generate run --stage audit
recon-lab generate status

# Collect signals (§4.3 Phase 4)
recon-lab collect

# Merge data
recon-lab merge

# Train models (§6)
recon-lab train --model all
recon-lab train --model ranker

# Evaluate with EVEE (§7)
recon-lab eval --experiment recon_ranking.yaml

# Validate ground truth
recon-lab validate

# Check pipeline status
recon-lab status
```

---

## 11. Setup

```bash
# Initialize the workspace (one-time)
bash recon-lab/setup_workspace.sh

# Or with a custom location:
export CPL_LAB_WORKSPACE=/mnt/data/recon-lab
bash recon-lab/setup_workspace.sh

# Add to .bashrc to persist:
echo 'export CPL_LAB_WORKSPACE=~/.recon/recon-lab' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Training workflow (end-to-end)

1. **Clone + index** — `recon-lab clone --set all && recon-lab index`
2. **Ground truth** — `recon-lab generate run` (~24h for all 98 repos)
3. **Signals** — `recon-lab collect` calls `recon_raw_signals()` per query
4. **Merge** — `recon-lab merge` assembles training parquets
5. **Train** — `recon-lab train --model all` runs ranker → cutoff → gate (§6.4)
6. **Eval** — `recon-lab eval --experiment recon_ranking.yaml`
7. **Deploy** — copy `*.lgbm` into `src/coderecon/ranking/data/`
